### Errata

9:08 - 'Crime rate' and 'Poor criminal justice system' should take each other's place in the diagram. Crime rate is the dependent variable while poor criminal justice system is the confounder here.

9:46 - 'Crime rate' and 'Poverty' should take each other's place for the same reason as the previous error.
