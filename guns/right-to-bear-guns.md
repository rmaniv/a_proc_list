&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Range voting: The Prime Minister or the Chief Minister may create such a system that the voter may score between -100 and 100 marks to a candidate. If the voter only registers yes, it shall be considered equal to 100 digits. If the voter does not register his acceptance, it shall be considered as zero. But if the voter gives points then only the marks given by him shall be valid. This range voting procedure is superior to the acceptance system, and provides immunity from Arrow's Useless Impossibility Theorem.]
