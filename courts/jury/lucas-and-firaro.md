# Discussion on Trial by Jury (Exchange between Lucas Ribeiro and Firaro)

The following is an interesting discussion I read in the comment section of a YouTube video, "[What happened to trial by jury? - Suja A. Thomas](https://youtu.be/qVoYFYxGJPg)" between [Lucas Ribeiro](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsykfCY-OSV4MWgIpBzqjCg) and [Firaro](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1Ovc1YwMNwcYZ4iSffPZ9Q) that happened around 4 years ago. Firaro argued the way I would have if I saw this video and Lucas Ribeiro's comment back then, and because YouTube doesn't give s a direct way of sharing comment threads, I'd like to copy-paste that discussion here for easy access.

**Lucas Ribeiro:**

> Juries MAY? make errors?      That's an understatement. The reality is that a random average person in a group will fall prey to many cognitive bias and fallacies. As much as the idea of detachment of interests may foster a sense of blind justice, the net result is negative.
 
**Firaro:**

> that's a lot of assertions. judges are subject to those same biases, why does increasing the number of people involved not reduce the effect of biases? what would you suggest other than detachment?

**Lucas Ribeiro**

> Firaro 

> Cognitive bias gets stronger with more people because there is also the social bias, unless you separate the juri. One person alone, given that they make an effort, has a better chance to take those bias into consideration. Also, you can't know whether those chosen will be aware of all the problems. The judge is, of course, subject to bias as is all human justice, but I would rather focus on educating individuals so that they can judge better than to select a random crowd. My point is that we are better off relying on education(doesn't mean we shouldn't criticise it or that it is perfect as of now). I have no citations I'm afraid

**Firaro**

> social bias exists, yes, but if you're going with the crowd cause most of the jury believe something well... that still requires most of the jury to be of that opinion which is better than putting all your hopes on one person. or one jury member could convince them all, but that requires him to have a convincing reason or be very charismatic. if it's cause he's charismatic then at worse the jury is effectively one person, same as the judge.

> judges may be well educated yes, but the jury are likely to be informed of relevant information, and the judge is still involved able to provide his education to help. but the judge is biased, he wants reelection. and he can be bribed or threatened but it's harder to do those things to a jury as they're less publicly known and because there's more of them.

> plus if there's a 1% chance he messes up, that means 1/100 cases will suffer from that. but if there's a 5% chance eahc juror messes up, well it still requires half of them to mess up at the same time, which is less likely than that the judge will mess up

> im just unconvinced that single judges are better than multiple jurors. though i am convinced that human judgement no matter how used can have errors 
 
**Lucas Ribeiro**

> The chance of making good decisions isn't really directly proportional to the number of people making the decision. People aren't particularly logical, so the idea that it would be hard to convince them of something clearly wrong or that is actually uncertain is not solid; people everyday make bad group decisions. However, I do agree with you that more people can mean different points of view, some that may have gone completely unnoticed. But instead of a set of random people I defend a multitude of professional or semi-professional judges, as long as those judging have a good educational background in law. Of course, that wouldn't be so for every case, but I suppose juries aren't practical to have at every session either. With regards to the probability you used,  I want to point out that when judging, it's not as simple as A and B, there are a multitude of possible decisions, so juries are even more likely to be wrong, because now you must also attend to the wrong possibilities to which a more educated judge is virtually immune. For example, imagine a set of 20 possible outcomes, one is right and that one of them has been chosen for each case of a set of 1000 hypothetical identical cases: the judge may choose between 7 of those in the overwhelming majority, but the jury, being generally less educated and experienced, will chose between 11, so that alone broadens the chance of being wrong apart from the lessened competence in judging each possible outcome you talked about.  

> Kind of off-topic: The argument that the majority opinion is not correlated with well thought out and based-in-solid-knowledge opinions is along standing one against democracy, one that goes back to at least to the time of Socrates when he critiqued Greek democratic decision process(that wasn't very inclusive then, but still). And this is not a bad argument, in fact, history has backed it up time and time again. The problem is: what is the alternative?            This is not really relevant to the discussion, I just thought it would be cool to make a connection.

> Well you are right that if you can compose the jury of better people then that improves things. But im skeptical a professional jury would truly be better less-biased people. And m skeptical of the wisdom of giving so much power to a select few, this seems like the path to semi-oligarchy. One might think meritocracy, but once those with merit take power they'll do what they can to ensure they and their friends/descendants keep it, irrelevant of merit. This is already happening in politics but more power and less checks wont help that.

> Additionally these people have agendas, they want to keep their jobs and impress their coworkers and over time might partly homogenous opinion in their field. This will affect their rulings. Random jurors still have biases and agendas but far less, these other jurors they never have to see afterwards, their jobs dont hang in the balance at all, these are likely to be people of differing perspectives

> Yeah, democracy sucks, but it sucks less than all other options. I hate giving power to idiots, but it's a requirement of democracy. Just kind of wish people would stop encouraging everyone to vote, let those who dont care and havent researched not muddy the voting out of obligation if they dont want to. Let those who care and researched be a greater percentage of the voters, just by power of self-selection.
> I hadnt known that bit about socrates, interesting
