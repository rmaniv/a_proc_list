The dispute-resolver could be a single judge or a bench of judges or an officer (like Collector, Secretary) or a Jury (randomly chosen citizens) or some combination.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Now on many issues, such as determining facts, setting hearing dates and giving benefit of doubt, the written laws tend to leave the matter at the discretion of individuals who are resolving the disputes. Also, the dispute-resolvers may interpret the laws as they seem fit. So once the dispute-resolvers are determined, the speed and fairness of the court will depend less on the text of the law, but will depend more on the nature of dispute-resolvers. As a saying (maxim) goes, “Equity lies in individuals” i.e. fairness is in individuals (judges or Juries) who are giving judgements, not the law.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">So what are the qualities that dispute-resolvers should have to ensure fairness and speed?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The dispute-resolvers should be skilled, intelligent and have knowledge of laws. But many (such as myself) believe that 2 factors are 1000 times more important than skill, intelligence and knowledge. These 2 factors are i)dispute resolvers must not have nexuses with eighter parties or their lawyers and they must not be partial ii)dispute-resolvers must have intense Hatred against criminal and corrupt.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Partiality/nexuses in dispute-resolvers</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The partiality/nexus makes all skills, intelligence, knowledge etc. useless. To explain the evil effect of partiality/nexus, I would give examples from the best box office hit in this Universe, The Mahabharat. In those days, India used system of fixed judges for resolving disputes. The title of judge was Raja and that of chief judge was Maharaja. But the titles are immaterial. A judge is a judge by any title.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Here is an example of partiality. Duryodhan had committed several criminal offenses before the War became inevitable. When Kauravs and Pandavs were children, Duryodhan tried to drown Bhim in a pond. The chief judge of Hastinapur, Dhritrashtra, acquitted him. Then Duryodhan tried to burn Pandavs in a “laksh” house. Again judge Dhritrashtra acquitted him. Next, Duryodhan cheated Pandavs in gambling and harassed Draupadi. Once again, Dhritrashtra acquitted him. Next, Duryodhan imposed 14 years of “Vanvaas” and after</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Vanvaas, Duryodhan refused to give the kingdom back. Each time, Duryodhan’s offence grew in severity and yet judge Dhritrashtra acquitted him. The result was the War.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">An evil result of nexus was Professor Drona’s chopping Eklavya’s thumb. Prof. Dron chopped Eklavya’s thumb because he did not want any possible competition from Eklavya who could have started his own University. Also Professor Drona he had a nexus with Arjun. But what made Prof. Dron so fearless and exhibit such mindless cruelty? Wasn’t he afraid of punishment? After all, Eklavya was a minor (below 18). Without Eklavya’s parents’ permission, it was criminal to make him chop his thumb. But no, Prof. Drona knew that even if Eklavya’s parents had complained before chief judge Dhritrashtra, judge Dhritrashtra would have dismissed their complaint. Prof. Dron was also sure that judge Dhritrashtra would not take any “suo-motto” action. Dron could act so rampantly because of the nexuses he had with judge Dhritrashtra.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Another example of nexus was silence of dozens of officers/judges (like Prof. Dron, judge Bhishm etc.) when Dushashan harassed Draupadi right in the Supreme Court of Hastinapur. Why was each of these officer/judge silent? Why didn’t anyone threatened an action or at least a resignation? Because each of these officers/judges had nexus with judge Dhritrashtra or Duryodhan and so none took any action. The partiality/nexuses had killed the integrity of judge Dhritrashtra, Prof. Dron, judge Bhishm and other officers/judges in Hastinapur’s Executive and Supreme Court.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The chief judge of Hastinapur Dhritrashtra was skilled, intelligent and very knowledgeable about law/morals/Dharm/etc. He had several knowledgeable advisors. But each one had one or other kinds of partiality/nexus. So fairness had vanished from Hastinapur’s supreme court (i.e. “Raj Darbar”).</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Reducing the effect of partiality/nexus in courts</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">One can belittle CJH Dhritrashtra’s partiality/nexus by a counter-argument : every man is likely to have partiality/nexus, so why blame judge Dhritrashtra or any other judge of past or any judge of present? The argument  is  correct.  But  then  why  give  power  to  resolve  all  disputes  to  a  SMALL  group  of judges/kings/priests/lords? Say five or ten <i>different </i>citizens were chosen at random from Hastinapur to judge upon Duryodhan’s various crimes. The randomly chosen citizens would NOT have shown partiality that judge Dhritrashtra had shown each and every time. They would NOT have acquitted Duryodhan for serious crimes like harassing Draupadi. And the punishments in these crimes would checked his behavior.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 155%;text-align: justify;">In short, the if the same persons decide upon all the disputes, the system starts rotting due to the partiality/nexus that those persons have with their friends, lawyers, individuals who assist them in becoming judges etc. Later this partiality/nexuses results into “cash and carry” corruption.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Purpose of this book</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">My ONLY goals are to reduce the poverty and improve the fairness and speed of the courts. To me, this looks impossible without establishing administrative procedures based on two Assertions of Veds : first, the natural resources belong to the Nation ; second Panch Parmeshwar i.e. Panch (i.e. citizens chosen at random) represents The God.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The first assertion can be realized administratively using the Quota Systems. In my first booklet, I described the Share System for Underground Water.

The civil courts here also play important roles. When civil courts go unfair and slow, the citizens would try to resolve disputes by criminal means thus creating law and order problems. In fact, when citizens solve civil disputes by criminal means, it gives rise to open and organized criminals who will openly threaten citizens. For example, in India, the civil courts are slow to the extent they are non-functional when it comes to evicting tenants of debt-recollection even when the debtor has money to repay. So the landlords and loan-givers end up</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">using criminals. There has even been a case where a judge asked a gangster for debt-collection instead of filing a case in court.

The reason is NOT the human values etc. In fact, a huge chunk of doctors and nurses in US, UK etc are Indians, Chinese, Filipinos etc. The reason is - Juries have time to investigate the cases in detail and they impose heavy fines on the hospitals when a negligence related case comes in before Jury. While judges simply do not have time to examine the case in detail. Further, a judge being a powerful and upper class individual seldom faces the problem of negligence. So a negligence-related case gets neglected in judge system. So hospitals in judocratic states seldom take pains to ensure proper care.</p></li><li data-list-text="8."><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Poor service (compared to price) from electricity companies, phone companies, water supply companies and other private or state-owned monopolies and oligopolies : In all countries, following services tend to be monopolies or oligopolies <i>1)electricity 2)water supply 3)canals 4)railways 5)roads 6)phone and cell-phones companies 7)cable-companies 8)TV-channels 9)sewers and a few more</i>. The companies which provide these services may be state-owned or private. But in judocratic states (again, 3-4 respectable exceptions) these services are too expensive or very poor. While in ALL Juritarian Countries, the service are in very good shape and price is much less. (For example,  in Argentina (judge system), the price of water supplied in city is higher than that in New York even though cost is much less due to lower salaries. Likewise, in India, MSEB ends up paying a huge sum to Enron).

Now to collect the damages, he will have to go to a civil court. Now the supplier will be cautious ONLY if he fears the actions of civil courts which will depend on efficiency/fairness of civil court.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">…and many more</p></li><li data-list-text="1.4"><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Why court’s efficiency/fairness more important than culture etc.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In any culture, there are always a few individuals who will never keep the word. Now lets say that there are 5 suppliers (A1, A2, A3, A4, A5). And all except A5 keep the word i.e. they deliver after they receive cash, A5 will seldom deliver goods. Now after a few transactions, A5 will have more money than the rest and gradually he will become stronger in the market. Unless, the clients of A5 can force A5 to pay up for the damages, A5 will win. A crime DOES pay if the courts are inefficient.  And if crime does pay, number of criminals or violators will certainly increase</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Thus in even cultures where most citizens are honest, lack of efficient/fair courts can create very high level of dishonesty in the society.</p></li><li data-list-text="1.5"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">How Efficiency of courts minimize “Wrong Advantages”</p></li></ol></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In an economy, many transactions are of the type when two parties exchange goods (or services) and cash on the spot. But in many cases, one party pays goods/cash in advance and other party has to wait for cash/goods. In such case, the party which first obtains cash/goods may try to take wrong advantage of the second party. This wrong advantage in general ruins an economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The empirical observations show that tendency to take wrong advantages is there is humans in all Nations and States across the Universe, but in the Countries where courts are nexus-prone/slow, the individuals there have greater tendency to take wrong advantage then Countries where courts are nexus-free/faster.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">A logical analysis can easily explain this fact. Once Party1 has given cash/goods to Party in advance, the Party2 has monopoly over Party1 for a short term. And the cost of doing business with a monopoly will depend ONLY on how efficiently punitive fines can be imposed on a monopoly. In absence of punitive fines, the monopoly is guaranteed to be ultra-expensive.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">How do fast/nexus-free courts help? If the courts are faster/nexus-free and relatively cheap, then the suffering party is more likely to approach the court, which has necessary power to impose the fines and thus zero the benefits of negative advantages. The fear of fines keeps the party under control.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 155%;text-align: justify;">All roads lead to Rome, or rather all roads leave Rome. The conclusion is that : economy will collapse if courts are nexus-prone and in general if courts are nexus-free, the economy WILL ALWAYS function smoothly. This is <u>COURTISM</u> in a nutshell   a belief that courts are important in economy and economic</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">policies DO NOT play important role in economics. A directly opposite viewpoint is <u>Economyism</u>, that economic polices and markets are important, power-play and courts are unimportant. I subscribe in Courtism and has no faith in economyism.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: left;">Now how to make courts nexus-free?

Indians are failing because, at individual level, most Indians are under-performing compared to his counterpart in the west. Even though most Indians are working as hard as their western counter-part, and they are as smart and talented as their western counterpart, their combined output is low. One of the reason is slow and highly corruption-prone civil courts.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Out of 100s of problems which creep up in economy due to slow/unfair courts, I will discuss following as examples:</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Example 1: High rent</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: left;">Example 2: High difference between bank interest rate and interest rates on private-loans Example 3: Lose of faith in checks</p></li><li data-list-text="2.3"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;">How sluggishness of civil courts increase rent</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Today (Nov 2000,before Jan26, 2001 quake) in Ahmedabad, over 40000 apartments are lying vacant. And there are lakhs of people who are living in poor housing even when they are willing to pay a rent of Rs 1000 per mo. for a 1-room-kitchen house. They are not able to find a rental easily, because most apartment owners are afraid of renting an apartment. The reason is - if the tenant refuses to evacuate, the owner has to go to court and the court may take 2-5-10-20 years to give verdict even in such a simple case. Even when apartment is given on lease and if the tenant stops paying the rent, it is not easy to get an eviction order from the court. I would not compare India with US, UK etc. But even in lesser developed countries like New Zealand, courts on such matters give judgements in 1-2-3 months. The sluggishness of India’s civil courts has decreased</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">number of house/office owners interested in renting. And so, there are fewer apartments available for rent and so the rent goes up. And the higher rent hurts an Indian industrialist/trader when he has to compete with an outsider, who pays relatively lesser rent.</p></li><li data-list-text="2.4"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">How sluggishness of civil courts increase interest rates</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">When an amount is loaned out, three factors determine interest - 1)interest given by a nationalized bank on deposits 2)risk of the business 3)“legal risk”.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The legal risk is - say A gives loan to B; say after 1 year, B DOES HAVE sufficient money to repay the loan but he refuses to repay; then how easy is it for A to recollect the money via court-system? The legal risk in India is extremely high. Even with a written agreement, courts take years to give judgements. In US, UK, New Zealand etc. courts take less than 1-2 months to resolve a simple case involving loans if the borrower DOES have money to repay. Of course, when borrower does not have money to repay, the issue is complicated in all countries. Today in India, thousands of extremely rich and wealthy individuals have borrowed money from banks and are refusing to repay. Such phenomenon exists ONLY (I repeat, ONLY) because of sluggish/corrupt courts. The problem is NOT due to corruption in officers and MLAs/MPs/Ministers.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The high “legal risk” in India increases the interest rate. And the higher interest rate hurts an Indian industrialist/trader when he has to compete with an outsider</p></li><li data-list-text="2.5"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">How sluggishness of courts reduce check transactions?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In US, New Zealand etc, the checks are trusted just like cash. In India, very few businessmen accept checks. The reason is - if the check returns in US, New Zealand etc. the receiver can drag the payer to court and get the amount in 1-2 months. But in India, even such cases are taking well over a year. No businessman can afford to wait for 1-2 years in a transaction-type business.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">As a result, too many transactions are done by cash and this reduces productivity. Every time cash is exchanged, both parties have to count. Too much time is wasted in counting, accounting and tallying. Now when a businessman needs to buy something by paying cash, he must go to the bank, withdraw the cash, send a trusted person to deliver the cash etc. In case of check, it is possible to send the check by mail. In addition, there are theft related problems with cash. Due to possibility of theft, the trader has to increase the profit margin. All this mess only increases the costs at each level and reduces the speed at which transaction occur.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Checks increase efficiency at each level. When a product finished in India is compared with a product finished with west, the details of manufacturing and accounting will show that each transaction in west used check while in India almost all of them used cash. The added inefficiency rises the price.</p></li><li data-list-text="2.6"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Which “infrastructure” plays more crucial role in economy?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 155%;text-align: justify;">Many articles I read complain that India has poor “infrastructure” than west. The word “infrastructure” commonly covers telephones, railways, roads, electricity, water supply network etc. But very few articles focus on the “judicial infrastructure” i.e. setup needed to resolve disputes between two parties. Efficiency of most individuals in an economy will eventually depend on how efficient/fair the civil courts are. Also, no matter how  vibrant  a  nation’s  economy  is,  the  nation  will  collapse  if  corruption  is  rampant  in  officers/</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">/Ministers/judges. And the level of corruption in officers/Ministers/judges depends ONLY on one parameter - efficiency/fairness of courtroom. It will be impossible for Indians to compete against citizens of other countries which have faster and fairer courts. Forget the international competition, if the sluggishness of courts continues, Indians will soon live an extremely miserable life.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The second worst problem and yet second least discussed problem in India is sluggishness and corruption in the courts. And even when discussed, the debate ends with trivial suggestions like “increase the number of judges”, “allocate more money for court administration” etc. Most of the suggestions are immature and wrong. Later, I will discuss the flaws in some commonly given suggestions.</p></li><li data-list-text="2.7"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">How to improve efficiency/fairness of India’s courts?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 155%;text-align: justify;">After a systematic comparison of court-systems or rather “dispute resolution systems” of several countries, I have concluded that the one and ONLY one reason why courts in US, UK, New Zealand etc. are faster and fairer is because they use Jury System instead of “system of fixed judges”. And one and ONLY one way to improve fairness/speed of Indian courts is to replace the system of fixed judges by the Jury System.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="3."><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -23pt;text-align: justify;">Systems for selecting dispute-resolvers: judge system and Jury System</p><ol id="l8"><li data-list-text="3.1"><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Disputes and Dispute Resolvers</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The societies created courts and “Judicial Procedures” to resolve disputes amongst the citizens.

The dispute resolvers, are not merely someone who suggest a solution, but someone who can force both parties to obey the solution. Other Judicial steps are - summoning both the parties and witnesses, setting the hearing dates, going through the evidences and arguments, declaring the judgement and finally forcing both parties to obey judgement.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Now lets consider the first Judicial Procedure - choosing the dispute resolvers.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 155%;text-align: right;">Two systems have been used in all the countries in past 5000 years to select/appoint dispute-resolvers: system of fixed judges (or judge system or judocracy) and Jury System. I will briefly describe these two systems in this booklet. Other systems to choose dispute-resolvers are combinations of these two basic systems.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 156%;text-align: left;">Common wisdom says - judges and Jurors, both may take bribes. So what is better in Jury System<i>? </i>A short answer is <i>-</i></p><ol id="l9"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Jurors are not known in advance and so it is lawyers etc. cannot have nexuses with them.</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: left;">Jurors (common citizens) have intense Hatred against corrupt officers and criminals; while the judges do not have much Hatred against criminal and corrupt.</p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Jurors do not face the possibility of loosing bribes in future and have no ambitions</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">So it is difficult to bribe majority of Jurors and even in case a Juror takes bribe, he is still very likely to declare a corrupt officer or a guilty person guilty. Of course, this is a short answer and raises several sub-questions. This book answers some of the sub-questions.</p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="3.2"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">The “system of fixed judges” to appoint dispute-resolvers</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 155%;text-align: justify;">What is the “system of fixed judges” or “judge system” or “judocracy” for selecting dispute-resolvers? A system where a <u>small number</u> of individuals are appointed to resolve almost all the disputes in the society. These individuals often have a permanent tenure. And amongst judges, their is a systematic command hierarchy which makes it an organized and established bureaucracy, and hence the term judocracy.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.3"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">The Jury System for selecting dispute-resolvers</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In the Jury System, when there is a criminal/civil dispute or a complaint against an officer - about 10-15 citizens are chosen at random from the voter-list ; both parties present their case before these citizens ; and finally these citizens give the judgement. So structurally, the difference between two systems is quite minor. Both judge system and Jury System use courts and allow parties to cross question each other.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.4"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Nations with Jury System and states with judge-system</p></li></ol></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">So there are two systems in courts : judge system and Jury System Which countries use which of the 2 systems? Lets divide all the countries of our Universe into 2 groups - 1)the Nations with Jury System i.e. Juritarian Nations and 2)the states which have fixed judges, i.e. judocratic states.</p><p class="s10"

But only in India, the outgoing judges appoint the new judges and elected heads are mere rubber stamps. Since in reality, the judge is more powerful than PM/President, the India is not a “republic” in true sense.</p></li><li data-list-text="4.2"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Criticizing a judge in India - point a finger, loose the hand</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Rakshashputra Manu says - if a shudra ever preaches religion to a priest, the king should pour hot oil in his mouth. It appears that judges in India see more virtue in Manu than in the Constitution’s article describing “Freedom of Speech”. The “contempt of the judge” related law, <i>as the judges interpret it</i>, means - if a judge</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">suspects, with or without any reasons, that a person’s statement or a mere remark will lower the reputation of judges in the society, the judge can throw that person in the prison for six months. Worse, even if the person’s statement/remark is 100% factually correct, then also the judge can throw him into prison. “The Truth shall not be a defense”, said a judge when commenting on this draconian law. Even the worst dictators in the world have not been so arrogant. Mahatma Gandhi once mentioned that the most virtuous aspect of Hinduism is that Hinduism considers Truth above God. In contrast, the judges consider themselves above Truth. And irony is that a witness or complainer or accused is asked to take oath to speak the complete truth, while the judge declares that (in case of contempt related cases) he will not take the truth as a defense. It is important to note the law, as passed by MPs in 1972, is not so dictatorial or draconian, the judges have interpreted it that way.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The restriction also applies on the MLAs/MPs. In India, MLAs/MPs cannot be punished for what they say in Assembly/Parliament, but a judge can throw an MLA/MP into prison if he criticizes a judge outside Assembly/Parliament even if MP/MLA is expressing the voice of his citizens. And inside Assembly/Parliament, the Speakers never allow an MLA/MP to criticize a judge, even if MLA/MP is expressing the sentiments of his constituency’s citizens. In most civilized democratic countries, the representatives are not silenced by their Speakers.</p></li><li data-list-text="4.3"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Why my rhetorical sentences against judges?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The rhetoric, or logic, is because the draconian enforcement of “contempt of judge” has stopped all debates about improving the status of courtrooms in the country. In order to explain the flaws in several court procedures, it becomes necessary for a person to show how a nexus of judge and lawyer can cause a disaster. To elaborate, it becomes necessary to give example of how judges have misused these procedures in past. But the moment a person elaborates how some judges misused those powers, he risks a prison sentence. And so the debate does not happen.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">No newspaper, till today, has been able to write anything on corruption amongst judges. Even judge Pathak, who gave one of the most corrupt verdicts in India, was only mildly criticized by journalists. Today it has become impossible to break the myths that are prevalent such as - a)myth-I : increase the powers of the judges and number of judges, and all the corruption of officers will go away !! b)myth-II : allow the judges to strike down candidates from elections, and criminalization of politics will end. One would risk a prison sentence if he says the obvious, that if judges are allowed to strike down election candidates, it would only increase corruption amongst judges.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">An argument in favor of contempt related clauses is that citizens must respect judges. This argument is wrong. And if not, only the respected ones should be made judges. And throwing a judge-critic in the prison is the stupidest way of obtaining respect. Any student in political science and sociology can show that prisons may obtain a superficial discipline but never fetches respect.</p></li><li data-list-text="4.4"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">In short</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In short, “judge system” is a system where dispute-resolvers in court are fixed and are appointed for a permanent tenure. In addition, in India’s judge system the judges appoint judges and not elected heads and judges throw judge-critics into prison.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="5."><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -23pt;text-align: justify;">Why judge system fails everywhere</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The more I see trial by judge, the highly I think about Trial By Jury - B R Wise, Councel to of Austrian Executive, 1948.

I will explain how and why these factors disappear in the judge system. In the next chapters, I will show that Jury System preserves these factors.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="5.2"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">The biggest disadvantage of judge system - dispute resolvers are well known in advance</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Lets take the case of subordinate courts i.e. courts which come under High courts. In most cases, one judge would cover an area that come under one police station, with approximate population of 50000 to 2 lakhs. Consider High Courts. A typical High Court in India has 20-50 judges. These 20-50 judges will hear all the cases that come in the High Court. In short, the judges are well known and known well in advance.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">So lawyers, officers, policemen, builders, contractors, rich businessmen, newspaper owners, TV-channel owners, smugglers, gang leaders etc. very well know that sooner or later, that perticular person would be handling a case in which they could have a stake. So lawyers etc. are more than eager to be in the judge’s good book. So several lawyers, officers, criminals etc would start offering favors to judges.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 155%;text-align: justify;">Do judges in India accept favors? Thomas Jefferson, founder of USA, had commented in 1800 AD their judges are as honest as average citizens; no less but no more; and things are no different today, be USA or India. It is the nature of  ordinary humans, including judges, to accept cash and other favors. And then, in order to get more favors in future, it becomes necessary for the ordinary humans to reciprocate.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">When a person has too much power, along with favors also come blackmailing. Every established person in administration has to fear from the newspaper-owners and TV-channel-owners. And I don’t think judges can be exceptions. In order to protect personal reputation, reputation of fellow judges and judiciary as a whole, it is necessary that newspaper-owners do not start a venomous campaign against judges. (The kind of campaign newspaper-owners conducted against Rajiv Gandhi and killed his reputation.) So even if we get 1000s of humans with strong integrity, and make them judges, the sheer blackmailing pressure that newspaper-owners and TV-channel-owners will put on them will dilute their integrity in a few years.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">So in short - because it is known in advance that a judge would rule on 1000s of small-big disputes in a region, lawyers, officers etc. offer cash/favors to him. Sooner or later, the judges get swayed.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Initially, the lawyers etc. asked judges only to make small favors. The judge could have declined, but then lawyers etc. would also stop giving favors to that judge. So the judges entertained their small requests. Then some of the lawyers started charging their clients for judge’s favors. Later, some of the lawyers started giving a percentage to judges who gave the favor.</p></li><li data-list-text="5.3"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Repeated exchange of favors leads to formation of nexuses</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Initially, it was mere familiarity between judges and lawyers and between judges and officers ; then some exchange of small favors ; later exchanges of large favors ; and later the relationship grew into nexuses ; and later it degenerated into “cash and carry”, “over the counter” corruption.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Do criminals have nexuses with judges? It really makes no difference. The judges have nexuses with lawyers. And lawyers have nexuses with everyone - criminals, smugglers, MLAs, MPs, officers, Ministers, executives, businessmen, newspaper-owners, TV-channel-owners, builders, landlords, contractors etc. After all, it is lawyers’ can defend everyone, be innocent or criminal. So whether a judge has nexus with criminal directly or via lawyer is more of a cost-accounting question - fairness is dead anyway. For example, in case of judge J W Singh, <i>Bhai Shiromani </i>Shakil had nexus with judge via his lawyer. It was fortunate that police unearthed this nexus in time or else, sooner or later, <i>Bhai Shiromani </i>would have started directly dealing with the judge.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">So in short : the first most necessary requirement for fairness (no nexuses with either of the two parties or their lawyers) is absent in judge system.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: left;">Do all judges have nexuses with lawyers? Certainly not. But those judges who did, progressively became stronger and stronger. And the weaker judges had to quit. As time goes, the fraction of judges with nexus rises. (Likewise, not all politicians are corrupt but businessmen/contractors systematically weed out those who are NOT corrupt. So fraction of corrupt politicians increases. And not all policemen are corrupt, but the few policemen who are corrupt are enough to wash out the good deeds of the non-corrupt. And as the corrupt policemen become stronger, they replace the non-corrupt ones from the important positions.)</p></li><li data-list-text="5.4"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;">Why judges have less Hatred against criminals/corrupt</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: left;">In all societies, citizens of rank and file have Hatred against criminals such as murderers, robbers, thieves, cheaters etc. The citizens also have intense Hatred against corrupt Ministers, corrupt officers, corrupt</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 156%;text-align: justify;">policemen and corrupt judges. This Hatred is NOT evil. In fact it is the MOST noble and most powerful form of the God in this Universe. The Hatred, against criminal/corrupt, is God.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: justify;">Many of us mistakenly mis-interpret our Hatred as morality. In most cases, morality does not exist, ONLY Hatred exists. The Hatred is often morally justified sometimes to a certain extent. The morality is needed for society’s well being. But still, morality inside a human mind does not exist, it may exist in the outside world as an explanation to justify The Hatred. Even if morality exists, the mortality never never never translates into an action, while Hatred often translates into an action. In fact, sacrifice can come only from a person who Hates. To act against corruption, some sacrifice of time, money, energy, and opportunity is needed. And only Hatred can bring such sacrifice. Therefore, Hatred is God and morality is just an illusion.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">There is a plenty of Hatred against criminals/corrupt in common citizens. But such Hatred is absent in most officers, Ministers and judges. Why? Lets consider some scenario.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Reason1 for lack of Hatred : Corruption</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: right;">A street hooligan extorts money from small victims like slum-dwellers, pavement vendors etc. He also beats and dominates the residents particularly women, children and old. The citizens have intense Hatred against such criminals. But such criminals regularly pay cash to the officers. These criminals never harass policemen or policemen’s family members. In fact, they would treat them with utmost respect and do several favors to them. So a criminal is a burden on citizens, but a source of income and so an asset for the policemen and other officers, Ministers etc. So citizens have Hatred against criminals; but policemen, Ministers etc. do not In the same way, a corrupt/atrocious policeman is a liability on citizens. But for a judge/Minister, he is</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">not a liability at all. A policeman may casually beat up an ordinary citizen, but would not even raise a finger at a judge/Minister. And a corrupt policeman has more reasons to respect the judges/Ministers.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Reason2 for lack of Hatred : Never facing harassment</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">A corrupt clerk/officer will never ask a judge/Minister to give bribe, but instead he would very promptly dispose the judge’s/Minister’s work. A judge/Minister never faces the kind of harassment that common men face every day, every hour and every minute. So a judge/Minister seldom develops The Hatred that common men have against criminals/corrupt.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">So in short : the second most important factor necessary for speed and fairness (Hatred against criminal/corrupt) is absent in judges since a judge never faces harassment from corrupt-officers and criminals.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">No Hatred, no motivation for revenge against crime/corruption aka “Justice”.</p></li><li data-list-text="5.5"><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;">Secession of the well-offs from the worse-offs</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">What is secession of well-off (i.e. rich aka upper-class) individuals?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">A phenomenon noted in ALL countries of this Universe throughout last 50,000 years is - almost all (not all, say over 99%) well-off individuals are least interested in solving the problems of worse-off individuals. And if a worse-off individual becomes well-off, within a few months he looses interest in solving worse-off individuals’ problems. Over 99% well-off individuals get extremely irritated when someone even speaks about</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">worse-off individuals’ problems. These days (Nov 2000), in a party of well-off individuals, it is impolite to even mention that worse-off individuals exist, and they have problems.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Take for instance the recent trend in English newspapers. Now a days, issue of poverty is on back seat. And problems of rationing system are seldom discussed. Instead what is more important are news related to H1B visas, environmental issues, conditions of tigers and leopards in zoos etc. Recently, in Ahmedabad the issue of crunch in parking space due to illegal construction took precedence over health problems caused due to spilling of gutter waters into drinking-water tanks in poor areas. In past, the well-off individuals invented a theory that worse-off individuals are worse-off due to their Karma of past life, and thus casually ignored the problems. Today, well-off individuals have invented a theory of “economic determinism” and “all problems will <i>soon </i>go away” to casually ignore worse-off individuals’ problems.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Even when it comes to removing corruption, the priorities of well-off individuals are different. For example, upper class individuals often complain against corruption in Income Tax Department, Sales Tax Department etc. But they would seldom show interest in reducing police atrocities. Why? Because well-off individuals do face harassment from IT officers, but it would seldom happen that a PI would get into the house of an upper class individual and beat up his family members, including old, women and children. So when it comes to removing corruption/atrocity, the well-off individuals give topmost priority to removing corruption in IT, Sales Tax, Excise etc Departments and hate to hear the argument that removing corruption/atrocity of policemen should get higher priority.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Here are two reasons why well-off individuals dislike to hear worse-offs’ problems.</p><ol id="l14"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The well-off individuals want tax-money to be utilized to solve their advanced problems. For examples, most well-off individuals in cities would rather like Governments to spend money on improving roads and parking spaces than spend money in municipal schools or improving quality of drinking water. In case, the problems of worse-off individuals get discussed in newspapers, Assembly etc., it may force some officers/Ministers to divert tax-money. This will be a loss to well-off individuals (i.e. rich).</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Well-off individuals seldom face the problems worse-off individuals face. Take for example, problems of petty crimes. The criminals prefer to make weaker people their targets, like old age folks, poor etc. Robbing a poor person will be less remunerative, but it is less risky. Also, most petty criminals live in poor areas and so poor people are within their reach. So well-off individuals seldom have to suffer from petty-crimes. Likewise , a well-off can always hire an agent to get government service, like passport etc. and so he will never have to stand in a queue and become victim of officer’s inefficiency. In general, the cash and connections saves them from many hardships.</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 155%;text-align: justify;">The two nations are separate altogether. The phenomenon that well-off individuals don’t want anyone to pay attention on the problems of worse-off is called “the secession of well-off”. The “secession of well-off” phenomenon makes judge-system a failure. Why, and how? Because, the judges as individuals are</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">very well-off individuals. And so, by the very nature of well-off individuals, over 90 out of 100 judges are simply not interested in even hearing the problems of worse-off individuals, forget taking pains needed to solve them. In addition, when a judge solves elite-members’ problems, the newspaper and TV-channels dominated by elite-members would praise him day and night. While a judge committed to solve worse-off individuals’ problems gets ignored by the newspapers and TV-channels and often gets ridiculed by elite-members.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 155%;text-align: justify;">So all over the world, in past or in present, the judges who took interest in the problems of worse-off individuals are  exceptions. <i>Over 90 out of 100 judges would rather spend time and energy in solving the problems that well-off individuals are facing. So for citizens at large, judge system fails</i>.</p></li><li data-list-text="5.6"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Other logistical problems with judge system</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Delay due to discontinuity</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In judge system, a judge ends up handling 100s and sometimes 1000s of cases <i>concurrently</i>. As an example, there are about 15-20 Metropolitan courts in Ahmedabad, each one has 1 judge, and each gets 2000-4000 cases <i>every year</i>. In a typical year, a judge will work for 250 days, 8-10 hours a day i.e. 2500 hours a year <i>at most</i>. There will be hearing of 20-50 cases each day. Many cases get next date without even one second of hearing. And often a judge will take a case for hearing, call the parties, read the notes, listen to the arguments for 10-20 minutes, make some notes and announce next date for further hearing. Now in next 5-6 hours, judge would attend some 10-20-30 more cases. So by the end of the day, he would have forgotten most of the details of the case. Next day, he would attend another 10-20 cases. And when the case comes again for the hearing after 2-3 months, he would have forgotten almost all the details of that case. So once again, he has to spend 5-10 minutes in reading the notes and refreshing the memory. It is not wise to expect that judge can keep details of 100s and 1000s of cases in mind all the time. Such concurrency gives rise to poor efficiency. And even if the judge is fair as an individual, no person with such an overload can be fair to so many cases.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: justify;">In contrast, in Jury System, the 10 Jurors have ONLY 1 case on their hand. So they can attend it for 5-6-7 hours in a day and set the next day for hearing, On the next date, the context of the case is in their minds. So it is possible for each Juror to be more attentive than a judge. So even if individual Juror is less knowledgeable than the judge, given that judge has very little time to spare will make him less fair compared to 10 Jurors.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Delay caused due to transfers of judges</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Suppose a judge is transferred to a place in Jan 1990. Now lets say some 5000 cases were filed in next 5 years and had some hearing. Now say in Jan 1995, the judge was transferred and a new judge takes his place. Now practically, most of the hearings of the unfinished cases would have gone waste as the new judge will have to hear parts of the case again. Of course, most judges do make notes so that the next judge can also get an idea. But in spite of these notes, the new judge will have to ask for many details all over again. Each transfer delays the case at least by 6 months to 1 year. Many times, when a case goes on for 8-9 years, it goes through 2-3 or sometimes upto 5-6 different judges. How can one possibly cross-examine the witnesses after 8-9 years? The delay caused by transfers are a problem that judge system can never ever solve.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Internal disputes at the time of appointing judges</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In judge system, the judges are extremely powerful. Once appointed, expulsion is next to impossible. And so there is a pressure on senior judges to be extra careful while appointing judges. They not only have ensure knowledge but integrity. Now the senior judges were often accused partiality. To circumvent the accusations, many State courts and the National court of India decided to have a panel of 3 or more judges, and a judge will get appointed only if panel approves him unanimously. Now each time a candidate came, due to differences amongst judges on how some laws should be interpreted, it mostly happened that 1 out 3 judges would disagree. Due to this large number of vacancies are unfilled. Also, the internal politics amongst judges plays a negative role in appointments.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: justify;">In Jury System, the judge’s role is minor and so a well qualified person is sufficient. This reduces the overhead that occurs in appointments and transfers of judges.</p></li><li data-list-text="5.7"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Don’t worry - judges in higher courts are not corrupt</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">One of the most ridiculous argument given by pro-judge folks in India is - “Agreed that there is significant corruption in judges of lower courts, but judges in the State courts and the national court are honest”. This shows how little knowledge they have about limitations of the common men in real life.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Saint Kabir once told me “Bada hua to kya hua, jaise ped khajur, panchi ko chhaya nahi, fal kage ati dur.” i.e. “so what if a someone is big but of very little or no use?” For 99% of citizens, the High courts and National court are beyond reach like “khajur-tree”. Over 95% population in India simply does not have money to go to High court. And in case we were to provide the legal aid, do the 600 judges in High courts have time to review even 10% of the judgements given by 10000 judges in the lower courts? Certainly not. The verdict of a judges in lower court will be last word in over 95% cases. So if judges in lower courts are corrupt, the honesty of judges in higher courts will help in only 5% cases, the damage is done in 95% cases will stay. This is sufficient to ruin a society economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The focus should be on improving the efficiency/fairness in lower courts, the higher courts are anyway of not much use to the common citizens.</p></li><li data-list-text="5.8"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Summary</p></li></ol></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">What is judge system, in short? A system where a small number of individuals resolve all the disputes and punish corrupt/atrocious officers/Ministers/judges. In the judge system, judges have a long and a permanent tenure. About 85-100 countries practice judge system.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Why has judge system failed in (except Singapore, Hong Kong, Israel, and Japan) ALL countries? Following reasons :</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Nexuses<span class="p"> - The lawyers, career criminals, rich-folks etc. offer favors to judges. The judges and lawyers have nexuses. This reduces fairness.</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The judges have no Hatred against criminal/corrupt<span class="p"> - One must have hatred against the criminals/corrupt to be prompt, attentive and fair at the time of resolving disputes. But judges don’t have much Hatred against criminals/corrupt.</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Secession of the well-off  (rich) individuals<span class="p"> - All over the Universe, in all cultures be Indian or Western or Chinese or Latin, over 99% well-off individuals are not interested in even hearing the problems of worse-off individuals. The judges are well-off and so like other well-off individuals they find it boring and irritating to attend worse-off individuals problems every day.</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Too many cases going on at the same time<span class="p"> - A judge has 100s of cases going on at the same time. Say he gives 10-30 minutes to a case and then sets a hearing date after 3-4 months. In between the two hearings, he will attend 100s of other cases. So at next hearing, he would have forgotten most of the details of the case. With such case-load, the fairest human being will be unfair to over 90% of the cases.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Due to above and other reasons, the judge system has failed not just in India, but in all the countries of our Universe.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l15"><li data-list-text="6."><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -23pt;text-align: justify;">Empirical evidences support Jury System and go against judge system</p><ol id="l16"><li data-list-text="6.1"><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Most and least corrupt countries</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">To show that Jury System is superior to judocracy, and to show Jury System more effective than judge system in checking corruption/atrocity of officers/policemen, I would give brief details of some of the countries.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 156%;text-align: justify;">Transparency International is “NGOs’ favorite”.

Mexico in 1800 was much larger than what it is today. About 4 states of US, namely Texas, California, Arizona and New Mexico were part of Mexico in 1800. Since Spain did not have Jury System, the Spain’s administration in Mexico too did not install Jury System. There were a few attempts to establish Jury System, but they were crushed. In 1810, Mexico became independent, but Spain was able to crush the rebels. The rebels fought again and by 1820 Mexico was fully independent. Thus Mexico was only 35-45 years behind US in obtaining independence.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In US, the law required that an officer must convince a Jury before the judge can announce a prison sentence. Likewise, suppose there are evidences of corruption against an officer, the Jurors can send that officer to prison even against the wish of the judge. As a result, so called “Inspector Raj” was not there in US. While in Mexico, the judge’s approval was sufficient to throw citizens into prison. And officers developed nexus with judges to ensure that judges will not punish even if they are caught red-handed with corruption. As a result, since the beginning, Inspector Raj type regime came into existence.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">As a result, Mexico’s economy has always been down. Tired of despotism, some people in Texas, California and Arizona revolted and asked for secession and decided to merge with US. This resulted into war between US and Mexico. Mexico lost and by 1850 Texas, California and Arizona became states of US.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Today, Mexico too is a capitalist country. It is quite wealthy in terms of per capita income and natural resources. Yet lakhs of Mexicans cross borders and work in US farms for mere $7 - $8 for a 10-12 hour day. This salary is absolutely meager in US, where legal minimum wage is $50 for a 10-hour day. The reason - in Mexico they do not even get $2 - $3 per day.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Except for few years of military rules, elections in Mexico are quite regular. Like US, Mexico has Presidential System. Like US, the Supreme Court judges are all powerful and have powers to imprison corrupt officers/Ministers. But the judges seldom use their powers to discipline the corrupt officers. Instead, they use it only to extract bribes.</p></li><li data-list-text="6.3"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Argentina - another classic failure of judge system</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Argentina is another country which uses judge system to resolve disputes. In 1800 AD, Argentina was more prosperous than US. The country became independent  in 1816. Interrupted by some military rules, regular elections have been held since 1816. The reason why military was able to take over is because the judges had failed to control corruption of officers/Ministers. Argentina has been a hallmark of capitalism - even the water distribution inside cities is via private companies.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The judges in Argentina, like all other countries that have judge system, have all the powers needed to punish corrupt/atrocious policemen/officers/MPs/Ministers. But in past 180 years after independence, the judges have been total failure in providing protection to citizens from lower ranks of policemen. Since 1810, the entrepreneurs and small farmers are constantly harassed by government officers and they have no options but to pay them hefty bribes. Many left and decided to settle in US where harassment of officers is negligible. The complete privatization of utilities such as electricity, water supply, telephones etc. has reduced corruption, but extremely heavy profiteering has overall created a much higher burden on the citizens.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">All in all, the judges in Argentina have been total failures.</p></li><li data-list-text="6.4"><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Conclusions</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The empirical evidences, such as list of countries, are not sufficient, but then, entire field of sociology and political science is based on nothing but empirical evidences. Whatever may be the limitations of empirical evidences, what is fact that empirical evidences do not support culture theory or any other political structure but support the religion of “Jurism” (i.e. corruption/atrocity can reduce ONLY by Jury System).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="7."><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -23pt;text-align: justify;">Proposed modifications in India’s judge-system, which are bound to fail</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Today (Nov 2000), in India, there is no hope that corruption amongst judges would decrease. Today there are several J W Singh type judges in lower courts and soon some of them will get promoted into State courts. And sooner or later, they will also find place in the National court.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">By all means, the judge system is beyond repair.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Yet some pro-judge anti-Jury folks enthusiastically and gleefully propose some fixings which they claim would improve the judge system. I believe all their remedies will fail. In this chapter, I would describe some of the proposed fixes and will demonstrate how they will fail.</p><ol id="l17"><li data-list-text="7.1"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Will increasing number of judges help?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Will increasing the number of judges reduce the problems of judiciary?</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No. Not at all.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: left;">An analogy is - will increasing the number of Ministers increase efficiency of the government? No. In fact, if number of judges increase, the corruption amongst judges will become more rampant. Why would corruption increase? There are 3 reasons - reduction in size of pie, lessening of control and “retirement blues”. <u>Reduction in size of pie</u></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">I will explain this by example of IPS cadre. During British regime, there were very few IPS officers in a state, often less than number of districts in a state (for example, Gujarat and Maharashtra combined had about 25-30 IPS officers in 1945). The IPS officers used to get hefty bribes from merchants etc. and so they seldom took money from street goondas. But today there are dozens of IPS officers all over and many of the lucrative responsibilities of police was handed over to other newly created departments. As a result, pie per IPS officer became smaller and they started taking cash from liquor dons, street hooligans and other small time criminals. Now the small criminals were not in a position to pay a huge sum up front. So policemen started taking small sums at regular intervals. This made corruption amongst policemen retail and periodic.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In same way, even though over 50% judges in junior courts are corrupt, they take bribes in less than 5% cases. These cases are large enough to meet their goals. But if there are 4 times more judges, each judge will get much fewer plump cases. And so they will have to take bribes in much larger fraction of cases he gets. And so the overall corruption will increase.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">And increasing number solves only delay problem, not corruption and delay created because of corruption. For example, increasing the number of policemen will reduce some inefficiencies such as time it takes to deliver court summons. But hoping that increasing number of policemen will decrease number of illegal gambling houses, illegal liquor sale, “hafta-vasuli” (where a street’s <i>dada </i>publicly collects money from shopkeepers and street vendors) etc. is insane. The gambling houses etc. are public knowledge and of course policemen know about them. Gambling houses continue because they pay bribes to policemen. So increasing the number of policemen will have no impact on them.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Likewise, if number of judges increases, some procedural delays will decrease. But cases like judge J W Singh, judge Pathak etc. did not go wrong due to fewer number of judges. They went wrong because there is very little control over judges. Now increasing number of judges will further reduce the control over judges, and situation will simply go out of hand.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Lessening of control</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Today there are 600 judges in the State courts and 21 judges in National courts. They have miserably failed in controlling 10000 judges of District, Metropolitan etc. courts. Now if the strength of junior judges is increased from 10000 to 40000, how will 600 high court judges control them? Then shall we raise the number of State court judges from 600 to 2000 and increase number of National court judges from 25 to 100? This will be a <i>Kumbhmela </i>in State courts and National court.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Such increase in number will create more problems than it will solve.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Retirement Blues</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Another reason why corruption will increase when the number of judges increase is as follows. A senior IAS officers, like Department Secretaries etc. get very plump jobs in private companies after they retire. But a junior IAS officer, who retires as Collector or Deputy Collector becomes a common man. Now a few years ago, there were so few IAS officers that most saw a possibility of becoming a Secretary or at least a Joint Secretary. So what checked corruption was the need to maintain reputation. And only reason to maintain reputation was the desire to reach the top. Now these days, top is unreachable, reputation is useless. So as the population of IAS officers increases, many IAS officers do not hope to become even a Joint Secretary. Becoming a common man after enjoying power is an officer’s worst nightmare. Result? The junior IAS officers have no hopes of reaching the top, and so they resort to rampant corruption.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The same “retirement blues” effect can come in a much more fatal way in judiciary. In judiciary too, an outgoing judge, if he has enjoyed a senior position at the time of retirement, can work as a top-notch lawyer, consultant or arbitrator. There is also a possibility of getting position in various Commissions. For this, a good reputation is needed and the need for reputation keeps corruption in check. But if the number of judges increase to 3 to 4 times, for many judges it will be clear that they will never ever reach a senior and visible position. The effect? More rampant corruption at junior levels.</p></li><li data-list-text="7.2"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Can National judicial commission improve the situation?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Not at all. It will worsen the situation.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">A much hyped up concept is National judicial Commission. The proposed Commission will have 10-15 members of which majority will be ex-judges. The proposed Commission will appoint and transfer judges and expel the misfit judges. No clear written proposal has come in place as yet. The most controversial issue is -will Commission have power to expel a judge in National or State court without permission of Parliament? Today, a National or State court judge cannot be expelled without impeachment by 2/3<span class="s17">rd</span> of MPs.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In any case, NjC will be a total failure. Today, we have 3 tiers in hierarchy of judges. The National court judges are regulators over State court judges and State courts judges are regulators over junior judges. We know that National court judges have failed to reduce corruption in State court judges and State court judges have miserably failed to reduce corruption/despotism in junior judges. In fact, State court judges have failed to impose even basic discipline over junior judges. Hoping that putting 10-15 more regulators at the top of the pyramid will bring a dramatic improvement amongst 10000 - 12000 judges is impractical. And if number of judges are to increase to 40,000 as requested by many folks, there will be no way by which the 10-15 member commission be able to regulate so many judges.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Giving power to NjC to expel judges will be a total disaster. If NjC members get power to expel judges, the NjC members will literally force the judge to give the judgements they want. The situation will become similar to the way PM/CM force their Ministers to take decisions. Today, State court and National court judges are less corrupt than policemen/Ministers. But if NjC gets power to expel judges, corruption amongst judges will cross all levels. And it is more than likely that multi-national companies will ensure that their favorite</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">retired judges get the seats in NjC. If that happens, then within 1-2 years, each judge in practice will become a multi-national companies’ agent.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Jury or no Jury, NjC is a very dangerous proposal for citizens of India.</p></li><li data-list-text="7.3"><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Can Lokadalat solve the problem?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The Lok Adalat works ONLY when both parties have intention of ending the dispute. But where one of the parties is a career criminal or a corrupt officer or a person determined to take advantage of slowness of the courts, he can simply refuse to walk into Lok Adalat. Now lets say that 2 brothers are fighting for land left by the father. Legally, it would become necessary to divide the land. But the son who is currently possessing the land would like to see the case go as long as possible. Many cases fall in this category and so Lok Adalat does not help. Likewise, Lok Adalat cannot be used for punishing corrupt officers, as the corrupt officer will simply refuse to come to Lok Adalat.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Now if Lok Adalat is made binding, all the problems of regular courts will creep into them. Extensive formalities and documentation will become must and this alone will slow down the proceedings. And given the new legal power, the corruption can also start creeping in.</p></li><li data-list-text="7.4"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Can Panchayati Raj solve the problem?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">One of the worst hype in India is Panchayati Raj - a totally useless concept.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">First of all decentralization is NOT democratization. For example, emperors like Akbar and Aurangzeb had handed over some of the powers to the Subedaars (Governors of Provinces) and they had also forced Subedaars to hand over some powers to their juniors. This decentralization was NOT democracy as the power never reached the common citizens.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The Panchayati Raj is decentralization. But it is done ONLY to keep the party workers happy by giving them some of the powers of MLAs/Ministers. The party-leaders gave away some powers to party-workers. But this power given to Panchayat Members will never reach common citizens. And so Panchayati Raj is NOT improvement in democracy.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">As expected, the Panchayat Members are as corrupt as MLAs/MPs. No one should have any hopes from them. Besides the most drummed up concept, Gramsabha, has zero powers and so it is nothing but a time wasting debate club.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The Panchayati Raj can become very useful if Gramsabha has powers to <u>dismiss</u> Sarpanch, Panchayat Members, expel Panchayat staff members and transfer Talaties and other government employees. With a powerful Gramsabha, Panchayat can become useful for citizens, otherwise Panchayats are useless.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The Jury System is true Panch Raj. The citizens are chosen from Gramsabha and is not a sitting body. Please note that Jury System has NOTHING to do with EXISTING Panchayati Raj. The believers in</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Jury System, such as myself, firmly believe that giving power to same individuals again and again will cause corruption/atrocity and they will soon form nexuses. The Panchayat Members are there for 5 years. Within 1-2 years, they will form nexuses with Talaties, Collector and other officers. Once Panchayat Members develop nexuses, they will become leech just like MLAs, MPs, Ministers, officers, judges etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The Panchayati Raj is useless unless Gram Sabha gets teeth. And Jury System is one way by which Sabha can get some teeth.</p></li><li data-list-text="7.5"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Can Nyay Panchayat help?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Any decision taken in Lok Panchayat or Nyay Panchayat can be appealed in court. So the loosing party will almost always go to court and so we are back to square one.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Also, it will be stupid if a dispute in village is arbitrated by someone living in that village. There will be too much proximity and that will create nexuses. When arbitrators or dispute-resolvers personally know the parties involved, they will tend to be biased and show partiality.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">It is best that a dispute between 2 parties is resolved by 5-10 individuals, ALL of whom are stranger to both. So when 10 Jurors are chosen from 5-10 lakh citizens of a district, it is guaranteed that almost all of them will be strangers.</p></li><li data-list-text="7.6"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Can National Human Rights Commission be of any help?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The senior members of NHRC are ex-judges, ex-MPs, ex-MLAs, ex-Ministers ex-etc. who had miserably failed to protect citizens from police atrocity when they were in power. It is not worth hoping that they can protect citizens with lesser firepower.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The NHRC does not solve the riddle AT ALL. The key riddle is - should NHRC chiefs be given power to transfer/expel policemen? If NHRC chiefs do not have power to transfer/expel policemen, the policemen will ignore them the way they ignore other citizens; and if NHRC chiefs have powers to transfer/expel policemen, they (like Ministers/IGP/Commissioner) will force policemen to cough up bribes. The key to police corruption/atrocity problem is - “Who should have power to transfer/expel a policeman, and what guarantee is that he would use that power only against corrupt/atrocious policemen?”</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The Jury System solves that problem - the 10 randomly chosen citizens know that they will be powerless in a week, they have Hatred against corrupt/atrocious policemen and they have respect/need for honest policemen. So they can be better trusted with this power than NHRC-members, who will be from elite anyway.</p></li><li data-list-text="7.7"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Can reservation in judges’ posts help?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">But given the caste bias in judges, I do support caste and gender base reservation in judges’ posts. I support caste-based reservation in judges, not because it would help SC/ST in any way, but I despise the castist and elitist behavior of the existing judges.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">I would support 22% reservation for SC/ST (with 7% for ST/SC women), 45% reservation for OBC (with 15% reserved for OBC women) and 33% for general (with 11% reserved for general women). This reservation should be in junior courts, State courts, National court and coming National Judicial Commission. There should be no recruitment in general category till these fractions are met. Also, if there is bench of 3 judges, at least 1 should be woman and 1 should be SC, ST or OBC. Similar rules for should be there for larger benches. And for chief judge in State courts and National court, in a 10 year period - 1 year should be for SC</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">judge, 1 year for ST judge, 2 years OBC judge, 3 years for woman judge and 3 years for judges of general category.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">But this reservation is not going to help SC, ST, OBC or women at all. After all, all IAS officers, Ministers etc are Indians and yet they are selling India to foreigners to fill their pockets. Those SC/ST/OBC/women who get into power using reservation become as corrupt as those of general category and would not spend a minute of their day for the upliftment of their community-members.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Wouldn’t caste based reservation in judges worsen the quality of judges? No it won’t. And it would certainly NOT worsen the quality of service that judges as a whole provide to common men in India. In judge system, power to resolve some 10000 disputes (every year) arising in a district of some 10 lakh is concentrated into 10-20 judges. With such concentration and centralization of power, poorest quality of service is guaranteed</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">- even if all 10-20 judges are geniuses. Replacing some upper caste judges with those of lower/middle caste will NOT worsen the quality.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Once again, I support caste-based reservation amongst judges not because it would help SC, ST, OBC etc. individuals but because I am tired of castism amongst existing judges.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The Jury System has better representation without any reservation. When 10 citizens are chosen at random from a voter-list of district of 10 lakhs, it is almost certain that 5 will be women. If there are 4 women in one case, then there will 6 women in some other case - the sky will not fall apart. Likewise, in each and every Jury, there will be 2-3 SC/STs, 3-5 OBCs and rest upper castes. These 10 citizens will also representation all economic sections - poor, middle as well as rich. In contrast, the judge system can never represent poor as even if a poor man is made judge, within 1-2 years, he will become rich and so he will stop representing poors.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The Jury represents entire cross-section of society in the court room without any detailed rules of reservation. The judge system can never do.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: justify;">I will re-explain and rationalize the irrationality behind my proposal to create caste-based reservation in judges. Will hanging or imprisoning a murderer bring the victim’s life back? No. But still we hang or imprison him, as we Hate the act of murder. Likewise, I am sick and tired of castism in judges and so I want caste-based reservation in courts.</p></li><li data-list-text="7.8"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Are lawyers responsible for the mess in the courts?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">No. Only the judges are responsible. The lawyers are 100% innocent.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The lawyers present the arguments. They may even present wrong arguments, that too intentionally. But judges do have power to dismiss those arguments. If the judge sustains wrong arguments or delays the case due to a wrong argument, it is judge’s fault and not the lawyer’s fault. So called “court crafts” or tactics that lawyers use to delay and divert the cases succeed only because the judges are unconcerned.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Often lawyers are accused of corrupting the judges. When judges accept bribes/favors via lawyers, I blame only the judges and not lawyers. In such cases, the lawyer is just a intermediary like a postman or a peon. If he decides not to become intermediary, the judge will simply replace the lawyer and use someone else.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="8."><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -23pt;text-align: justify;">Why is Jury System better than judge-system for India?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Empirical observations show that countries with Jury (Jury) System have much less corruption, poverty, crimes and atrocities than the countries with judge system.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In earlier chapter, I pointed out why judge system in India is failing - a)many judges have nexuses with lawyers, criminals etc. b)most judges don’t have much Hatred against criminals/corrupt c)judges are well-off individuals and so not much interested in the problems of worse-off individuals d)discontinuity in hearing etc.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The factors important for fairness --- a)no nexus b)Hatred towards criminal c)no desire for promotion while resolving dispute d)desire to solve worse-off individuals’ problems e)less discontinuity in hearing ----</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">come very easily and inexpensively in Jury System.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">I will describe exactly how the above factors make Jury System fairer by giving some cases as examples.</p><ol id="l18"><li data-list-text="8.1"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Procedures in the Jury System</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">To explain, why Jury System will be better than the system of fixed judges, it is necessary to explain the exact selection process in the Jury System. The exact administrative procedures of Jury System can vary. The essence is same, that randomly chosen citizens, not judges, decide. In the first round, my proposal is confined to a perticular type of cases - citizens’ complaints against acts of corruption/atrocity done by officers. In my proposal, I have described the following procedures.</p><ul id="l19"><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -7pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Brihad Jury (or Grand Jury) : Its a body of 30 randomly chosen citizens with a term of 1 month.

The citizen and the officer will present their sides for at least 2 days. When over 5 Jurors declare that they heard enough arguments, the trial will end in 2 days. After the end of the trail, if over 7 out of 10 citizens declare that the officer is misfit, he will be transferred out of district.</p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -7pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">After three such transfers, he will be dismissed.</p></li></ul><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 7pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In case of Jury System, in general. the case is against any accused such as a criminal, not just a government officer.</p></li><li data-list-text="8.2"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Why will Jury System be fairer/faster than judge system in India?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I will describe why Jury System will be better than judge system in India for following types of cases</p><ol id="l20"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">cases of police atrocities</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">cases of officers’ corruption</p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">cases involving organized crimes</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">cases involving professional hit-men i.e. mercenaries</p></li><li data-list-text="5."><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">small stake civil cases</p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="8.3"><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Why Jury is better (than judges) for cases of police atrocities</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: justify;">Before I discuss corruption/atrocity problem with respect to policemen, I must say that policemen are much less corrupt than Ministers, MPs, MLAs, judges, IAS officers, finance department officers, sales tax officers, income tax officers, excise officers, customs officers, octroi officers, revenue department officers, RTO officers, civil supply officers, oil companies’ officers, coal companies’ officers etc. But the policemen, being more exposed to public get easily spotted. Also, they have to do the dirty job of beating the citizens. And mostly they have to do this beatings due to somebody else’s orders (often from Ministers/judges). By all means, policemen are far better than other staff members in government.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 155%;text-align: justify;">To understand why Juries will do a better job than judges India, I will repeat the disadvantages of judge system and show that none of those disadvantages are here. Consider a specific case : a policeman kills a person in the custody. Say the relatives complain before a judge in one case and complain before Jury in another case.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Difference in Jury Trial and judge trial in case where person was murdered in the police custody</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:6.215pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:39pt"><td style="width:254pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">complaining before judge</p></td><td style="width:254pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 22pt;padding-right: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">complaining before Jury</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 22pt;padding-right: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">(Jury consists of 10 citizens chosen at random)</p></td></tr><tr style="height:40pt"><td style="width:254pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Issue : Policeman offers a bribe</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Result : The judge is likely to accept the bribe.</p></td><td style="width:254pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Result : The jurors are also likely to accept the bribe.</p></td></tr><tr style="height:156pt"><td style="width:254pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Main Issue: <u>HATRED</u></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;padding-right: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The policemen seldom mistreat a judge or his family members.

The biggest problem ganglord will face in negotiating with 400-500 Jurors (or  their  relatives)  and  bribing  them  is  that  ganglord  will  have  to  delegate  the  task  to  his agents/employees. And the agents/employees may have to delegate it to junior agents/employees. Now it will certainly happen that agents take the cash and do not pass it to the Jurors. Rajiv Gandhi once mentioned that out of every Rs 1.00 GOI spends on poor, the poor gets only 15 paise. The intermediate officers chew away 85 paise. Likewise, if a don has to bribe 500 Jurors, and if gives Rs 5 crore to his agents and tells them to give Rs 1 lakh to each of the 500 Jurors, it is very likely that the agents will chew away most of the money and many Jurors would not even get Rs 1000.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">As a result, he will get punished in 3-4 cases. Once he gets into prison, his strength to extort money for citizens will drastically decrease.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Summary : Fate of professional criminal</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:6.215pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:20pt"><td style="width:254pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 22pt;padding-right: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">judge-system</p></td><td style="width:254pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 22pt;padding-right: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Jury System</p></td></tr><tr style="height:117pt"><td style="width:254pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Issue : Number of people to bribe</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;padding-right: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">There are 40-50 cases against criminal.

Most high profile criminals have a committed staff of a few dozen juniors. But that is not sufficient to carry out all the operations they need to conduct. So they often hire mercenaries or contract-criminals for specific tasks. Once the tasks is over, the mercenaries get paid, and they depart.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Most mercenaries, by nature, work and stay alone and hardly have 1 or 2 friends. They are not team players and are not good at managing juniors. So when they are caught, they do not have committed friends who on their behalf would negotiate with Jurors and try to bribe them out.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In judge system, the mercenaries can operate via lawyers. A mercenary would certainly know a 2-3 very good lawyers. And if the lawyer has contact with the judge (like the lawyer in case of judge J W Singh), the mercenary will get away. In Jury System, the nexus between lawyer and Jurors does not exist as Jurors are 10 randomly chosen citizens. So the mercenary would fail to approach the 30-40 Jurors of the 3-4 cases he his facing. As more and more mercenaries end up in prison, the organized criminals suffer a setback. It becomes more and more difficult for them to execute their operations and so they reduce their activities.</p></li><li data-list-text="8.7"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Why Jury will be more for small stake civil cases</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In civil suits where stake is small, the case matter is simple and often well documented. The biggest problem in judge system is discontinuity and loss of context in the judge’s mind. In the Jury System, the case will get discussed continuously for 4-5 hours a day and so will get resolved in 1-2 weeks or sometimes in 2-3 days. This all the landlord-tenant disputes, labor disputes etc. will get disposed very quickly.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The fast disposal of small civil suit will drastically improve the efficiency of crores and crores of small traders, craftsmen, entrepreneurs and industrialists</p></li><li data-list-text="8.8"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">How does Jury System kill other nexuses?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">India is currently plagued with dozens of nexuses such as Minister-officer nexus, criminal-policemen nexus, Minister-criminal nexus, officer-contractor nexus, Minister-contractor nexus, judge-lawyer nexus etc. The Jury System, compared with judge system, kills one and only 1 nexus - the nexus between lawyers and dispute-resolvers. How will it effect other nexuses?</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Well, all nexuses need ground and shelter. Without a shelter, a crime/nexus can spring up, but cannot grow. When a nexus grows, and when it involves more and more members, it leaves far too many objective and convincing evidences and witnesses all over. All these  evidences and witnesses finally do arrive in the courtrooms before the lawyers and judge/Jurors. When such evidences/witnesses are there, both the officer and the contractor will end up in prison unless they get <i>shelter </i>from the dispute-resolvers. In the judge system, the shelter comes due to lawyer-judge or Minister-judge nexus. But in Jury System, the dispute-resolvers (Jurors) have no nexus with lawyers. So in countries which use judge system, nexuses of all kinds grow while in Juritarian Countries, the nexuses spring up but do not grow.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Facts? In all of the 22 Juritarian Countries I mentioned, very few policemen have nexus with criminals, very few officers have nexus with contractors and rarely will a Minister have nexus with mafia. <i>In contrast, in each and every judocratic state, policemen-criminal nexus, Minister-officer nexus, Minister-mafia  nexus,</i></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">contractor-officer nexus, contractor-Minister nexus etc. has been steadily rising. <span class="p">No Juritarian Country has organized criminals which openly harass and threaten citizens. While except 3-4 judocratic countries, ALL 80-90 of them have organized criminals which openly harass and threaten citizens and extort cash from them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Also, in a Juritarian Country, nexuses exist in the areas which are outside the Jury Trials reach such as defense deals, political lobbying etc. Only that, which comes within the range of Juries is free of large scale nexuses. In fact, presence of corruption in US, UK, France etc. in defense deals, high positions and areas outside Jurors’ reach further proves my theory that in Western countries overall corruption is less compared to east NOT due to political culture but due to Jury System. If the corruption was low due to political culture, there should have been less corruption in defense deals and high positions as well.</p></li><li data-list-text="8.9"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Conclusions</p></li></ol></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">By all means, Jury System will do better in India compared to judge system. As a trial, the Assemblies should allow the Municipal Corporations (cities) and District Panchayats to adopt Jury System to resolve complaints against employees of Corporation and Panchayats. Also, the Assemblies should allow the Jury Trials to review policemen for 1 year and see if there are any improvements.

To show that, I would first describe the courtroom procedures in Jury System I have proposed.</p></li><li data-list-text="9.2"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Judicial Procedures in (proposed) Jury System</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Compensation to Jurors<span class="p"> : The Jurors get bus fare plus simple meal plus 50% of minimum wage in that area.. Thus Jurors have no reason to delay the case unnecessarily.</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Selecting dispute-resolvers<span class="p">  : The officer-in-charge will select 10 citizens at random from the voter-list and summon them. If citizens do not appear, he will summon a few more citizens, till there are exactly 14 citizens,10 Jurors and 4 Stand-by. So no one can put “his men” in the Jury.</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Selecting case coordinator<span class="p"> : Case coordinators will be appointed by Mayor and will have a fixed term of 2 years with no re-appointments. They can be expelled by a Jury Trial. They will get transferred every 3 months to a different district.</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Deciding the first date<span class="p"> : The day right after summoned citizens appear will have the first hearing.</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Arguments in the courts<span class="p"> : The complainer will speak for 1 hour and then the defense will speak for 1 hour. Like this, each party will alternatively speak for 1 hour. The other party can speak, ONLY if the first party asks a question or gives permission to speak. After 4 hours, each Juror can ask questions to any witnesses for exactly 10 minutes. On the first day, the lawyers cannot speak, only the complainer and accused can speak. The case-coordinator can only enforce the time limits and cannot decide what the parties will speak or not speak. Thus both parties have equal opportunities to present the facts. On each day, the case-coordinator for a case will be chosen at random.</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">No lawyer for an officer<span class="p"> : if the accused is an officer accused of corruption/atrocity, he cannot have a lawyer and must argue the case himself.</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Deciding next date<span class="p"> : The defense will first propose a date give a 10 minute explanation why so much time is needed. If complainer agrees, then there is no dispute and next date is thus selected. If the complainer disagrees, then the complainer will propose a date and explain why that date is more appropriate. Each Juror will select 1 of the 2 proposed dates. If 7 or more jurors select a perticular date, the next hearing will be set on that date. Otherwise both parties will again propose a date. If after 3 such votes, 7 Jurors do not agree the case-coordinator will throw a toss on the two last proposed dates and toss-winner’s date will be the date for next hearing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;"><u>Ending the trial</u> : Depending on the severity of the punishment, there will be minimum time set on the length of trial. For trial involving expulsion of officer, it will go on for at least 4 days. On 3<span class="s17">rd</span> day or later, whenever over 5 Jurors declare that they have heard enough facts, the trial will end on the next hearing. If on that day or next day, over 5 Jurors declare that they want to consider more arguments, the trial will continue. Or at any time, if one party requests resting of case, the case will end after 2 days. On the last day, each party will speak for 1 hour, each Juror will have 30 minutes to ask questions and then the Jurors will deliberate for at least 2 hours. After 2 hours, whenever over 5 Jurors declare that they have made up their minds, the deliberations will end and each Jurors will declare his opinion on punishment requested by the complainer.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Announcing the solution<span class="p"> : If over 7 citizens declare that they approve a punishment, such as expulsion of the officer, that will considered as the judgement.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Thus all the discretion, be setting the next date of the hearing to judgement is left on the Jurors and the case-coordinator is merely notes the time-limits.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">On the matter of law, the lawyers of both parties will advice the Jurors. In case the lawyers disagree, each Juror will decide on his own what the law is. I request the reader to notice that, in the proposed Jury where citizens decide if the officer should be expelled or not, there is no judge. The case coordinator is only to enforce the timings and for each hearing, the case coordinator will be different. So each day, there could be a different case-coordinator.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Now lets see why Jury Trials are faster.</p></li><li data-list-text="9.3"><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Jurors discourage lawyers from making time-wasting arguments</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">A judge has no reason to finish the cases earlier. Whether the case ends or goes on and on for years, his private life is not affected. In fact delay and backlog increases the power to judges, as he can provide a favor by quickly expediting a case. So a judge trial is full of irrelevant technicality, show of wisdom, meta-philosophical interpretations, grand words, quotations of all the wise-men round the world and other time-wasting features. But mostly a judge trial is void of details relevant to the cases..</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In contrast, the members of Jury (i.e. Jurors) get a small survival amount like Rs 30 - Rs 50 per day they attend. They attend the trial mainly because they are likely to face a punishment if they do not. And at the same time, they have Hatred against criminal, some sympathy towards innocent and a desire to punish the guilty and only the guilty. So they would like to give a fair decision but would NOT like to waste too much time out of their lives.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">So anytime a when a lawyer is wasting time, most Jurors will give minus points to him in their minds. And both parties know throwing technical details will only annoy Jurors and so each party avoids making technical arguments, unless very relevant to the case. As a result, there is less wastage of time.</p></li><li data-list-text="9.4"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">In Jury System, it is easy to increase number of courts</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In the judge system, a judge has lot of power. And so the salaries have to be much higher or else judges is likely to go corrupt. Further, a judge must have a permanent and secured tenure or again corruption is guaranteed. Due to this, the senior judges have to show a lot of care in appointing the new ones. So the rules and procedures for appointment become very complicated and time consuming. So it is not easy to increase the number of courts.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In the Jury System I have proposed, each party alternatively gets 1 hour for presenting its case. During its time, the party or its lawyer can say whatever they believe is important. There is no judge, there is a case coordinator who has to only enforce the time limits and answer questions that Jurors may have on the issue of law. Due to this simplicity, increasing courts is as simple as making new building and hiring some clerks, peons etc.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: justify;">Cost wise, the Jurors are cheaper. The salary plus allowances of judges will exceed Rs 30000 a month or else rampant corruption is guaranteed. Plus perks like a residence, free phones, a car, a driver, a peon at his house etc. Altogether, the costs may go over Rs 100,000 per month. In addition, there will be pension cost. A judge will work for</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: justify;">about 25 days in a month, and about 11 months a year. Thus a judge would cost over Rs 3000 a day. In contrast, the 10 Jurors will cost Rs 500 - Rs. 600 per day and the case coordinator will be Rs 150 - Rs 200 a day with no pension. Thus overall cost of Jury Trail is much less.</p></li><li data-list-text="9.5"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">There is no discontinuity in hearings in the Jury System</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In judge system, a judge has several cases to attend in a day. As a result, each time a case comes up, he has to recollect all the arguments and read pages and pages of notes again. 10-20 minutes after he takes up another case, he will forget some of details of the previous case. And 2-3 months later when the case comes back for next hearing, he would have forgotten almost all the details altogether. This is not a flaw in the judge, this is quite normal for any human being. Such discontinuity of proceedings wastes a lot of time.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">But in the Jury System, the members of Jury (Jury) have only one case before themselves. So it is possible to spend the whole day on the same case, and it is also possible to set the hearing on the very next day. So the details and matter of hearings are fresh in the minds of the Juror each time. This will speed up the proceedings of a case.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Here I will counter the myth against Jury System that it is slower than judge system. A trained judge can dispose the case in, say 5-10 hours, while Jurors may end up taking 50-100 hours. But the argument that judge system is fast is wrong. In judge system, if one drastically increases the number of judges, the social influence the judges enjoy will go down and so corruption will increase. So it becomes necessary to keep the number of judges low. In such case each judge will be flooded with cases. Now say in a judge system, a judge works 40 hours a week. And a judge has 200 cases at hands. If he decides to give 20 hours to each case, it will take him 200*20/40 = 100 weeks = over 2 years to dispose the cases. But in case of Jury System, it is possible to have 40-80 trials at the same time, with 40-80 different Juries. Each Jury has ONLY case to attend. Now even if each Jury takes 100 hours, they will get disposed in 1-2 months.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Summarizing - 1) what makes a very fair individual an unfair judge in judge system is that every day he has to attend 10-15 cases 2)when the case comes for next hearings after 2-3 months, the details have gone out of mind. 3)also, the judge simply does not have enough time to spare. 4)while in Jury System, the Jurors attend the case continuously without getting disrupted by other cases. This improves the speed as well as fairness.</p></li><li data-list-text="9.6"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Bribing dispute-resolvers to give more and more dates is difficult in Jury System</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In case of Jury, the party which is interested in causing the delay will have to bribe at least 5 Jurors, again and again, everyday. It is very much possible to do so. But here lies the risk - a juror can record or videotape the exchange of bribe and then blackmail that party to pay huge sum. The Juror, since he has only chance to take bribe, if he is willing to take bribe, will try his best to set a trap. Once 1 or 2 such cases happen, the lawyers will start refraining from giving bribes.</p></li><li data-list-text="9.7"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">It will be easier/fairer to resolving pending 3 crore cases using Jury System</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lets examine the issue of speed with some numerical details, with respect to existing situation of India</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Today there are over 3 crore cases pending in India. Lets say that it would take 16 hours for a judge to resolve a case on an average. Say the Jurors will be 5 times slower i.e. it would take 80 hours for a Jury to resolve the same “average” case.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">Number of days a judge would take to resolve a case = 2 Number of days a judge would work in a year    = 250</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">Number of cases a judge can resolve in a year    = 250/2 = 125 Number of judges in India            = 10,000 (approx.)</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">Number of years 10000 judges can resolve in a year = 125 * 10000 = 12,50,000 Number of years needed to resolve 3 cr cases   = 300,00,000/1250,000 = 24 yr</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">So it would take over 24 years for judges to resolve the cases, <i>assuming no new cases are filed, </i>no appeals and that average case will take 2 days. If even 5% of cases go to appeals, the time span can increase to 50-100 years.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">What would it take to resolve the cases in 1 year using judge system? To resolve all the cases in 1 year, India would need to hire 240,000 judges. And 240,000 courtrooms. Each judge must be given a salary and allowances of Rs 30000 or else over 90% of the judges will start taking bribes. In addition, the government will need to provide each judge a car, a bungalow, a <i>maali</i>, a driver, a peon, free phone calls from office and home, medical care for entire family, security, etc. This will add up to over Rs 100,000 a month.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The worst problem is - once these 240,000 judges are hired and say they resolve the pending 3 crore cases in 1-2 years, what will they do with once the cases are over? If these judges are to be fired after the workload is over, the anticipation that they are likely to be fired after 1-2 years will cause extreme insecurity amongst the judges, and this insecurity will result into more corruption. So if fewer judges are hired, so that none need to be fired, the delay will increase.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Now lets see the situation in Jury System. With the money spent on salaries, bungalows, cars, drivers etc. of 240,000 judges in 6 months, it would possible to make 20,00,000 rooms to conduct Jury Trials. Say each Jury Trial takes 2 weeks. If 20,00,000 trials are conducted in 20,00,000 Jury rooms, each month 40,00,000 cases can be resolved. Thus in less than 1 year all the pending cases can be resolved. And once resolved, no judges need to be expelled.</p></li><li data-list-text="9.8"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Conclusions</p></li></ol></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">All 5 reasons which cause delay and disruption in cases go away in the Jury System. This will make courtrooms much faster. Please note that it ONLY makes courtrooms faster. It is The Hatred in the minds of Jurors against criminal/corrupt that makes the Jury System fairer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 86pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/></body></html>
