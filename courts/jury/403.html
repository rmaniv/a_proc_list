The “Judicial Procedures” are steps a “court” would take to resolve the disputes.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 156%;text-align: justify;">The first explicit or implicit step that a society takes to resolve a dispute is to appoint dispute-resolvers. The dispute resolvers, are not merely someone who suggest a solution, but someone who can force both parties to obey the solution. Other Judicial steps are - summoning both the parties and witnesses, setting the</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: left;">hearing dates, going through the evidences and arguments, declaring the judgement and finally forcing both parties to obey judgement.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now lets consider the first Judicial Procedure - choosing the dispute resolvers.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 155%;text-align: right;">Two systems have been used in all the countries in past 5000 years to select/appoint dispute-resolvers: system of fixed judges (or judge system or judocracy) and Jury System. I will briefly describe these two systems in this booklet. Other systems to choose dispute-resolvers are combinations of these two basic systems.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 156%;text-align: left;">Common wisdom says - judges and Jurors, both may take bribes. So what is better in Jury System<i>? </i>A short answer is <i>-</i></p><ol id="l4"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Jurors are not known in advance and so it is lawyers etc. cannot have nexuses with them.</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: left;">Jurors (common citizens) have intense Hatred against corrupt officers and criminals; while the judges do not have much Hatred against criminal and corrupt.</p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Jurors do not face the possibility of loosing bribes in future and have no ambitions</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">So it is difficult to bribe majority of Jurors and even in case a Juror takes bribe, he is still very likely to declare a corrupt officer or a guilty person guilty. Of course, this is a short answer and raises several sub-questions. This book answers some of the sub-questions.</p></li><li data-list-text="1.2"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">The “system of fixed judges” to appoint dispute-resolvers</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 155%;text-align: justify;">What is the “system of fixed judges” or “judge system” or “judocracy” for selecting dispute-resolvers? A system where a <u>small number</u> of individuals are appointed to resolve almost all the disputes in the society. These individuals often have a permanent tenure. And amongst judges, their is a systematic command hierarchy which makes it an organized and established bureaucracy, and hence the term judocracy.</p></li><li data-list-text="1.3"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">The Jury System for selecting dispute-resolvers</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In the Jury System, when there is a criminal/civil dispute or a complaint against an officer - about 10-15 citizens are chosen at random from the voter-list ; both parties present their case before these citizens ; and finally these citizens give the judgement. So structurally, the difference between two systems is quite minor. Both judge system and Jury System use courts and allow parties to cross question each other.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The pro-Jury anti-judge folks (like myself) believe - <i>if it is well known in advance that a small group of same persons, i.e. appointed judges, will rule over and over, the lawyers/officers/rich-people will immediately start establishing relations (read nexuses) with the appointed judges</i>. And later on, not everyone, but over 50% to 70% of these appointed persons will become corrupt and nexus-prone. So pro-Jury anti-judge folks (like me) believe that it is best to keep the dispute-resolvers should not be well known and permanent. Analytically, one can show that choosing citizens randomly from the adult population is the best way to avoid nexuses.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In contrast, the pro-judge anti-Jury folks believe that common men are stupid and more corrupt than elite-members. And so only the chosen-ones, i.e. judges, should resolve the disputes.</p></li><li data-list-text="1.4"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Similarity between judge system and Jury System</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In this booklet, I will enumerate several differences between judge system and Jury System. But before that, I will mention a similarity between the both.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">This similarity is the dark side of any society - no society can exist without state sponsored violence, fear, terror and punishments. Or I would put it another way - till today, non-philosophers have not been able to figure out a way to administer the society so that the citizens would not need to inflict punishments on any of its members. When a non-philosopher can suggest such an organization, the need to issue punishments would stop and the debate between judge system vs Jury System will go away.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">But as long as state needs to punish, we need judges or Juries.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In short, the similarity between judge and Jury is - both issue state sponsored punishments.</p></li><li data-list-text="1.5"><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Nations with Jury System and states with judge-system</p></li></ol></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">So there are two systems in courts : judge system and Jury System Which countries use which of the 2 systems?

For example, “Does the teacher know <i>science</i>?” is an</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">irrelevant question. The relevant question is “Does the teacher know specific topics to the depth as required by the syllabus?” After all, not every teacher need to know every topic in Science to the Einsteinian depth.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">So the question that “do citizens know the law” should be “do citizens know the law regarding disputes given to them to resolve?” I will classify some the disputes and show that over 99% disputes are simple enough that citizens do the law needed to resolve them. And in the remaining 1% cases, judges are ONLY marginally better than Jurors.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">To show that citizens do know the law, I will consider following types of cases</p><ol id="l8"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">cases where officers/Ministers/judges are accused of corruption/atrocity</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">small civil disputes involving land, house, divorce etc.</p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">small criminal disputes like fights, non-serious threats</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">complicated civil/criminal cases</p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="2.2"><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Do citizens know the law dealing with corruption/atrocity?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Consider my first Jury-related proposal, where 10 citizens decide if the officer should be expelled/transferred or not for alleged corruption/atrocity. A citizen who has gathered evidences against officer can present it to Nagricpanch and request the transfer/expulsion of the officer. And likewise, if the officer is transferred before the completion of his term, he may approach a Nagricpanch for cancellation of the transfer.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Now  some  civil/criminal  cases  and  laws  can  be  complicated.  But  the  law  related  to corruption/atrocity is simple - if the officer has taken a bribe or unnecessarily harassed anyone, he should be expelled and punished. These cases are more related with evidences and facts related to some perticular actions rather than law. The citizens have to decide whether the officer acted to protect the society or to extract a bribe. This is a matter of day-today experiences, it does not need specialized training in law. And specialized training in law does not help either.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Now I will answer the question : “do citizens know the law?”. When it comes to deciding if the officer is corrupt/atrocious, or whether the officer fit to serve the citizens or whether he should be expelled, there is not much of the law involved. This deduction is from facts and one’s opinion. Any person with no nexus with the officer or complainer or their lawyers will give a fair answer.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">So in corruption/atrocity related cases knowledge and wisdom of randomly chosen citizens is adequate.</p></li><li data-list-text="2.3"><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Most civil cases are not that complicated</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: justify;">What is the stake in an average civil case? Unfortunately, there is no official data. So lets take a guess. In India, today over 3.5 crore cases are pending. Of these 3.5 crore over 60%-70% are estimated to be civil cases. So say there are over 2 crore civil suits. Of these 2 crore, over 50% are perhaps are related to land and buildings. Now even if one assumes that every piece of land and building is under litigation, it would mean than average suit claim is below a few lakh rupees. That is assuming that all the land and building are under litigation. If one puts a reasonable over-estimate that perhaps less than 5% of land and building are under litigation, then average case is perhaps a few tens of thousands of rupees or may be a few lakhs.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">A large number of civil cases are related to 1)property like a house or small piece of land under inheritance 2)divorce related disputes 3)debt resettlement involving small loans 4)landlord/tenant disputes 5)labor related disputes.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In most cases involving inheritance, the story is same - a father died and has a house and some land. One of the sons was possessing the house and land, while other was staying away. Now the possessor refuses to give the stake. So the other sons have to go to the court. The law is trivially simple - each son gets a share according to the father’s will or gets equal share if there is no will. But the case drags on and on because the judge does not have time. In many such cases, value of property will be only a few tens of thousand or at most a few lakhs</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Even if the value of property is large, a case involving 50 acre of land is as simple as a case involving 5 acre of land. Of course, a case involving 50,000 acre of land may not be simple, as such huge pieces of land may involve intricate contracts. The cases involving immense property (like several building, several plots of land etc) could be complex. But such cases are very few.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">In short, the question is: Do common citizens know the laws?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The answer is : in 90% - 95% civil cases are so simple, that citizens do know the related law.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Not only common citizens’ knowledge is adequate, but common citizens will show more concern than judges when it comes to solving small problems (like tenant-landlord dispute) which  block the life of commons, not the judges. So Jury System is adequate and better for small civil cases.</p></li><li data-list-text="2.4"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Most criminal cases are not complicated eighter</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">That was about property-related cases. What about criminal cases? Well, less than 10% criminal cases are serious violent crimes like rape, murder or pre-mediated violence. Most criminal cases are fights under alcoholic influence, threats with no serious intentions, small fights which resulted in no injury, petty thefts, accidents etc. Over 90% criminal disputes, even if proved, will get less than 1-2 years in prison.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Thus the reality is that in over 90% - 95% of civil and criminal cases, the matter is simple. So straight forward, that any person, who has lived in society can understand in 1-2 days.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">So once again, 90% - 95% criminal cases are so simple, that citizens do know the related law.</p></li><li data-list-text="2.5"><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Complicated cases : judges and Jurors are equally fit or misfit</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Most “complicated cases” that I studied, were complicated NOT because law was complicated but the case matter was very specialized and technical. Some civil cases became complex as the accounts were complicated.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In case of some technical laws or statutes meant for exceptional cases (like say for example, construction bylaws for high rise buildings) it may happen that Jurors do not know the exact laws in detail. But if a Juror does not know a law, the lawyers of eighter side can always explain him the law and its applications. And such things happen in judge system as well. Many times, lawyers have to politely explain the technical aspects of the case-matter and the laws to the judges. And when the cases and laws involve technical,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">mathematical, scientific and engineering details (like cases related to patents in engineering products) there are experts who are presented as witnesses, but in reality are meant to explain the details to the judges.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The judges are experts in law, but no one in this Universe can be expert in all branches of technology. So in case of complex technical cases, judges are only marginally better off than Jurors. And both, Jurors and judges, are equally fit or misfit when it comes to complicated accounts.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Summary? 99% cases are simple and where Jurors’ ability is sufficient and in 1% cases, judges are marginally better-off, not significantly. But on the integrity side, Jurors are way ahead of judges.</p></li><li data-list-text="2.6"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Doesn’t Jury System need highly educated citizenry?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The Jury System came in Britain in 1300 AD when literacy was below 2%, forget education. In US, it have been since 1800 AD, when literacy was low. Then also, Jury System was brought ONLY because citizens were sick of corruption/despotism of judges. Even with low literacy, Jury System gives MUCH better result than judge system.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In complex civil case, literacy and education can be useful. But in over 95% criminal and over 90% civil cases, even educate can understand the case matter. Besides, in today’s India, even illiterates are familiar with administrative setups and laws.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The argument of many pro-judge anti-Jury folks that “yes Jury System is good, but wait till we have over 90% education” is just another “postpone-forever” argument. The most needed feature in dispute-resolving is impartiality and even in society with lower education, Jury System provides impartiality and so it will be superior to judge system.</p></li><li data-list-text="2.7"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Do citizens have IQ to understand the law?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">“But do common men have basic intellect necessary to understand the laws and case-matters?” the followers of Rakshashputra Manu politely ask this question and add some artificial curios expressions. They ask this question to make a self-righteous statement that “common men are stupid and mentally incapable of understanding the laws” and that judges are extremely smart. The statement proves the 2000 year old superiority complex that Manuvadies have, and it is a waste of time to answer the question.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">My experience/belief is - if a law is derived by logic, common experiences and need of the citizens, it will be simple and straight forward enough that anyone can understand after an explanation by a trained lawyer. The explainer may have to work hard to explain the mathematical, scientific and procedural aspects, but the logic, intent and purpose of the law will become clear to Jurors in 1-2 days.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Besides, if a law is incomprehensible then it is in accordance with Natural Justice to grant some benefit of doubt to the accused that he indeed did not understand the law. Even if an action appears to be criminal, but it is apparent that the doer had no intention of committing a crime, giving punishments in such cases will do harm to whole society, not just that individual. Now if a law is indeed so complicated, it is possible that accused did not understand it, and so he had violated that law without a criminal intention. In such cases, it is lesser evil if Jurors acquit him rather than punish him.</p></li><li data-list-text="2.8"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">A general positive argument against “citizens do not know the law”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In reality, it is impossible for a person who lives in society and interacts with fellow citizens not to know Natural Law and other laws. There are 100s and 1000s of proverbs which reflect the morals or laws as practiced in the society and these proverbs are part of day-today vocabulary. One does not need to be even literate to know them, forget educated or trained in law. No matter how hard a person tries to be ignorant, he will end up knowing the basic laws in which society believes, such as not stealing, not killing etc.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Thus fact that a citizen lives in society proves that he knows laws in a sufficient details.</p></li><li data-list-text="2.9"><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">A general negative argument : doesn’t everyone know the law?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The pro-judge anti-Jury folks have two contradictory views. When a citizen is accused of violating a law, the judges, lawyers, law-experts, officers, experts etc. PRESSUME that he knew the law. And when a citizen comes as a dispute-resolver i.e. Juror, they argue that he may not know the law. This is a contradiction.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Most lawyers, judges, law-experts and most citizens agree that “not everyone know the law and no one knows every law”. In fact not allowing “ignorance of law” violates another accepted view (maxim) that, “impossibility should not be forced upon as a requirement”. If we interpret “knowing the law” as “knowing <i>all </i>the laws”, it is an impossibility. Even if one spends every minute reading laws passed by Legislatures and associated rulings by judges, it is not possible to read all the pages in 10,000 years. Thus knowing all the laws is impossible, and yet the officers/judges treat citizens as if the citizen knew all the laws.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">But the state/Nation has a valid reason to assume this impossibility. If the state/Nation allows “not knowing the law” as an excuse, too many accused may take advantage of it. And the state/Nation may collapse. So as a necessary evil, officers impose this half-possible and half-impossible requirement. Now since officers/judges rightly or wrongly do not allow a citizen to take advantage of “the ignorance of the law”, The Moral of Reciprocation (the only known Absolute Moral in this Universe) requires that citizen should not loose any judicial power for not knowing the law eighter. If a citizen is to suffer disadvantages of a “necessary-evil assumption”, the least that is must to be just is that the citizen should also get the advantages of the very same assumption.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">So if the State allows “not knowing the law” as an excuse, too many accused may take advantage of it. And so the society may collapse. Likewise, if the State allows elite-members, officers and judges to take advantage of “citizens do not know the law” argument, too many elite-members and judges will take advantage of this argument and the autocracy will become rampant. This too can destroy the society. So as a necessary evil, the State should always assume that common citizens know the law, whether they citizens are Jurors or accused.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: justify;">An interested reader might wonder - it is impossible to know all the law, then how can it be ever moral to expect an individual to know all the laws? In the realm of Philosophy, I know only one reconciliation - If a private good can very likely destroy sum total of private goods aka “the Public Good”, that specific private good should be abolished. So allowing a citizen to use argument that he did not know the law is a private good. But if allowed, it can certainly destroy other citizens’ private goods.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: justify;">This was a philosophical explanation. A procedural reconciliation is - the Jurors should assume that the accused knew the law, if under that circumstances, the law or existence of such a law was obvious. But if the accused can convince</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: justify;">them he did not know the law, and the law is indeed something that cannot be easily deduced [say for example law had changed recently and it was not well publicized], they may grant him benefit of doubt.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: justify;">The Arthavaved reconciles many such dilemmas in mere two words “Panch Parmeshwar” !! Of course, the Panch here means a Nagricpanch - randomly chosen citizens.</p></li><li data-list-text="2.10"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">Convincing anti-Jury that a citizen knows the law : commit a crime</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The pro-judge anti-Jury folks have a built-in contradiction when they say that a citizen as an accused always knows the law, but a citizen as a Juror may not know the law. So perhaps one way a citizen can convince a pro-judge anti-Jury Manuvadi that he knows the law is by actually committing a crime. Or perhaps, we can select Jurors from prison, because each accused knows the law.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">This attitude of pro-judge anti-Jury folks, and above solution, has a sociological significance. An administration based on such Manuvadi attitude 1)allows elite to exploit commons rampantly 2)snatches all opportunities from commons and finally 3)leaves no option for rank and file of common citizens to eventually become criminals.</p></li><li data-list-text="2.11"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">Aren’t citizens biased?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Another argument given by pro-judge anti-Jury is that citizens are lot more biased than judges. This is a lie - judges as individuals are as biased as anyone else.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">It is must that dispute-resolvers should NOT have any bias/nexus for or against any of the two parties or their lawyers; but it is NOT AT ALL NECESSARY that dispute-resolvers are unbiased towards everyone in the entire society. For example, it is possible that in a society, everyone shows partiality towards his sons, relatives, and friends. But between two strangers, they will have practically no bias. So in such a society, if 10 persons are asked to resolve ALL the disputes, the sons, relatives and friends of these 10 persons will take advantage. But for each dispute, if 10 citizens are chosen so that each of the 10 is stranger to both parties, the outcome will be free from bias.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In contrast, the lawyer-judge nexus is heavily built into the judge system. The judges, even if they are stranger to both parties, are NOT stranger towards their lawyers, as the lawyers and judge meet each other almost everyday. In addition, the judges also have nexuses with policemen and other wealthy folks.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Thus judges as individuals are as biased as Jurors and in addition, judges have nexuses. So Jurors are preferable.</p></li><li data-list-text="2.12"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">Are Jurors unbiased towards everyone?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Many pro-judge anti-Jury folks reject Jury System by citing that : a dispute-resolver should be unbiased towards EVERYONE ; common men have biases ; and so Jury System has flaw ; therefore we should continue with judge system.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Consider an argument : what is best is 24-carat gold ; 14-carat gold is not as good as 24-carat gold ; therefore 14-carat gold has flaws ; therefore we should continue with rusted iron</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">First of all, “unbiased towards everyone” is a useless over-requirement. Typically a dispute is between 2 parties and in some few cases, it would involve 3 or more parties. Thus if dispute-resolvers are unbiased towards EACH of the concerned parties and their lawyers, it is sufficient. Why should it be necessary that they</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">should be unbiased towards each and everyone. And when 10-15 citizens are chosen at random from a population of 10-20 lakhs, it guarantees total unfamiliarity. So Jurors are unbiased towards eighter parties and their lawyers.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: right;">Second, it is insane to think that existing 10000 judges of India are unbiased towards everyone and free from nexuses. The lawyers and career criminals do have nexuses with judges and nexuses can be more dangerous than biases. A man with bias will have a tilt but it can be overcome in cases of serious crimes even evidences show up. But a man with nexus is pre-determined. All evidences will be like pouring water on a rock. So if bias is an issue, Jury System has much less bias/nexus than judge system. None of the two is pure</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">24-carat gold. But the judge system is rusted iron while Jury System is 14-carat gold.</p></li><li data-list-text="2.13"><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">Caste bias in judges and Juries</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Certainly, there can be caste related bias in Jurors. But since 10 citizens are chosen at random, they will be from different castes and so the caste bias gets distributed. But in most cases, when a crime is proven, the crime becomes the main issue and caste becomes a secondary issue. If a person belonging to caste-A has killed a person of caste-B, almost all citizens, including the members of caste-A,  would agree that a murder is a murder and so the murderer must be punished. The caste-bias may exist in general, but when a specific crime comes into picture, the details of the crime would matter more.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">And caste related bias also exists in judges.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Summary? Bias is largely a product of culture and individual experience and is present in ALL individuals in general, judges as well as Jurors. So on issue of caste and other culture related biases, no system is better or worse than other.</p></li><li data-list-text="2.14"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">Aren’t citizens cowards? : The myth of the “judicial bravery”</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Many pro-judge anti-Jury folks cite that judges are brave while common men are cowards and so only judges will be able to punish powerful criminals. I personally believe that both judges and “common citizens” are equally brave/cowards. And in spite of that Juries (i.e. common citizens) will be more effective in punishing guilty rich and powerful.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Let me first break the illusion that judges are brave. They are brave ONLY against small weak people and elected heads, while they seldom raise voice against a military dictator or a foreign ruler or very powerful rich who also control media. For example, very few judges in Pakistan acted against even junior military officers’ atrocities. In India, during emergency (1975 - 1977) judges had chosen to blatantly ignore the atrocities of policemen and crimes of Sanjay Gandhi and his goondas. One judge went to the extent of saying that if policemen during emergency kill citizens, the citizens cannot complaint in courts ; and he wrote that he had “diamond-hope” that policemen will not misuse this absolute powers. Even the stupidest in this Universe will not put so much hopes in policemen. I believe that the judge was intelligent enough that he knew that he was wrong. He wrongly expressed this “diamond hope” because he was scared that Indira Gandhi might have ruined his career or Sanjay Gandhi and his hooligans would have beaten him right in his court or residence. It</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">was “diamond cowardice”, not a “diamond hope”. Had the judge been honest, and admitted the fear of Gandhies, he would have broken the illusion of “judicial bravery” and done a big favor to the citizens.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The failure of Indian judges to take action against rich white collar criminals is well known. For example, we always see that tax-evaders get minimal punishments in India there by giving rise to huge black economy. Also, no judge has entertained PIL against over Rs 70,000 crores of non-performing debt of nationalized banks. The reasons are anybody’s guess.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">It is a mute point that judges will NOT protect citizens from foreign oppression (imagine supreme court judges issuing stay order against Pakistani or Chinese aggressors and aggressors honoring that stay order). This is a contradiction in pro-judge anti-Jury Manuvadies : they DO want common men to sacrifice lives against foreign aggressors but DO NOT want to share the power of courts with commons. Conversely, if the common citizens are stupid/corrupt and judges/elite-members are intelligent/committed, shouldn’t we have armies consisting ONLY judges’ and elite-members’ children and nephews?</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Now common citizens are no braver than judges. Yet citizens (Jurors) will be more effective in punishing rich and powerful, if they are guilty. There are two reasons 1)the extreme Hatred citizens have can temporarily make them overcome the fear 2)a guilty rich or powerful will get involved in dozens of Jury Trials and each Trial will put him before 10 citizens ; so he will be against 100-200 Jurors ; he will fail to cover so many Jurors and so is more likely to loose (ants vs elephant situation)</p></li><li data-list-text="2.15"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">Aren’t most citizens corruptible as they have low moral values?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Do existing 10000 in subordinate courts in India have very better moral values than common citizens? Do existing 650 judges in State courts and 25 judges in National court have very high morals? Lets say that 90% of them have high morals. Then how come these 90% do not throw remaining 10% in prison?</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The reality is that moral values amongst judges is no better than those amongst citizens in general. Worse, a proverb in Hindi goes “ek aur ek gyarah hote hain” i.e. one and one make eleven. This is very much true in case of nexus. A dishonest judge and a criminal can cause some damage, but when they have nexus, they will cause 10 times more damage. So in Jury System, since Jurors do not have nexus with criminals, overall damage will be much lesser compared to judge system.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: justify;">Each time an anti-judge criticizes a judge of being despot, corrupt and anti-poor, the pro-judge folks loudly scream “contempt of the court/judge” and demand a 6-month prison sentence. However, they can casually say that “majority consists of fools” , “citizens do not know the law”, “citizens are stupid, corrupt and have low morals” etc. Isn’t it contempt of the citizens?</p></li><li data-list-text="2.16"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">Judicial Equality</p></li></ol></ol><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Is everyone equal before the dispute-resolver? Or do the dispute-resolver give equal weight to both parties. Say one party is rich or established or a career criminal while other party is a common citizen. Will dispute-resolver treat both parties equally? This is what I call as Judicial Equality or “equality in courtroom”. Lets compare extent of judicial inequalities in judge system and Jury System.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In judge system, consider the case when a judge is new and unfamiliar to every lawyer and every citizen in the town. Such a judge will be unbiased to both parties, and so overall he will treat both, rich and common, parties equally. <i>Lekin naya to tambaa bhi chamkta hai , puraana chamake wahi sonaa </i>(i.e. even a copper ornament would shine when it is new; only when an old ornament shines, we can say it is gold). On the day one in judge system, judicial inequality is low and within a few years it crosses all limits.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The lawyers, career criminals, rich folks, landlords know that this judge-<i>sahib </i>will be in town for 4-5 years. So out of 1000 lawyers, over 900 would try to get close to the judges. If the judge is from Satyug, all lawyers will fail but if he is from Kalyug (Aug 1947 onwards), say 10-15 lawyers will get close to the judge. Now those lawyers who are close to the judge-sahib will get better treatment from the judge; they will be more equal than others. And so the chances of winning increasing. Now these lawyers will raise their fees. So only the rich will be able to hire him. This is when the judicial inequality start increasing.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">But in Jury System, the all the 10 Jurors are strangers to each parties and their lawyers. So they will treat both parties equally.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Thus there is much less judicial inequality in the Jury System.

In fact, the famous “Charter of Magna Carta”, which is considered as hallmark of British Democracy and English Liberty speaks only about Jury System and does not even mention elections.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The misunderstanding</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The misunderstanding we have about the word “Democracy” is as follows :We have only one of administrative procedures needed for Democracy i.e. elections. In such cases, it is fruitless to expect any feature of Democracy to appear. Democracy with election, but no Jury, is a chariot with one wheel. Thus statesman after statesman from West were loudly screaming that Juries, more than elections, are must for democracy, rule of law, liberty, freedom etc. But somehow, Indians and particularly those in academicians, could only hear only the word “election” and disregarded the word “Jury”.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 156%;text-align: justify;">I will not go into details of definition of the word Democracy. Whatever the definition is, it does not matter. But I will try to show that expecting officers to work by public opinion is possible by Jury System, not by elections.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Elections are not as democratic as Jury System</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In election, the voters vote on the basis of 10s of major and 100s of minor issues. Many times, candidates themselves cannot figure out why they won and why they lost. Thus elections never give a clear feedback to candidate about what citizens want. Next, representatives elect CM/PM, who appoints Ministers, who appoint senior officers, who appoint junior officers. All of them are under tight control of judges on whom citizens have no control. Worse, elections give no procedures for citizens to fire a representative. Now suppose a junior officer does not work according to “citizen’s will”. The worst a citizen can do, without Jury System, is to complaint before a judge/senior-officer/MLA/Minister. Experience has proved that all 4 options are useless.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">A judge’s career is immune to “people’s will” and so there is no reason why he should consider what people think, believe and want. Now even if MLA wants to act according to “people’s will/wish”, he will have to act via a maze of officers and the sheer amount of work needed to do so will stifle his efforts.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The Jury System, in contrast, is far superior means of “citizens’ rule” as well as “rule of law, as interpreted by citizens”. For a complaint, it is feasible to choose 10 citizens at random. And given that these citizens have no nexuses with any of the two parties and have Hatred against corrupt/criminals, the 10 citizens will represent “citizens’ will” more effectively than the MPs, MLAs, Ministers or the judges.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">As an empirical result, elections without Jury, have failed in ALL the 85-100 countries where they have been tried out. The elections, without Jury, failed in capitalists societies as well as communists societies ; they failed in Presidential Government as well as Parliamentary Governments ; they failed in small countries as well as large countries. And many countries, who did not have universal suffrage, but had Jury System, (like Britain till 1920), had more humane governments than those with elections but no Jury.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Summary</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 155%;text-align: justify;">Summarizing, when a western statesmen, such as Thomas Jefferson or James Madison or Churchill says “Democracy” they meant elections plus replacing judges by Jury. The Indian thinkers, low in originality and poor at copying as well, have copied the word with only half the meaning. We in India have ONLY Indirect Lawmaking”, we DO NOT have democracy as defined by western statesmen.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.2"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">In reality, the courts are more powerful than Parliament</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The civics teachers have been telling the students that the Parliament/Assemblies are “supreme” in India; the members of these house are elected by citizens; and hence we have rule of citizens in India. THE END. No one could have been more blind.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The topmost power is NOT Parliament/Assembly (i.e. MPs/MLAs) but courts (i.e. judges). For day to day disputes, Parliament does not decide but a junior judge decides. Also, if any one sits in a junior courts for few hours, he would realize that the junior judges give their judgements based on judgements given by judges in State courts and National court. And the judges in National and High court give judgement based on their discretion, not the text of the law as passed by the Parliament/Assemblies. The law made by MPs/MLAs is lost like a needle in a haystack.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.3"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">The “system of fixed judges” is mockery of democracy</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The word democracy’s common meaning is “rule of citizens”. The procedural reality of any society is “rule via courts i.e. dispute-resolvers” ; so the dispute-resolvers are unavoidable middlemen and society cannot bypass them.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Now let’s “rule of citizens via judges”. When judges in junior courts do not have nexuses, what we have is “rule of law, law as drafted by high courts judges and supreme court judges”. And when junior judges have nexuses with lawyers, criminals, policemen etc. we have “rule of nexuses”, not “rule of law” or “rule of citizens”. In a nut shell, judge system is “rule of judges, by the laws made by the judges” in the best case, and “rule of nexuses” in the worst case.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The Jury System is “rule of law as approved by citizens”. And this coupled with democratic law making creates “rule by citizens, according to laws made and approved by citizens”.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">In short, Jury System is democracy. The system of fixed judge is nothing but a mockery of democracy.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.4"><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Creating “public opinion” is a useless exercise without Jury System</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In a Juritarian Nation, it makes sense for an activist to spend time, money and energy in creating and shaping “public opinion” on a specific issue (such as environment, human rights). When the citizens go in Jury, they would give verdict according to their views. For example, if activists try hard to convince citizens about human rights, the Jurors (i.e. citizens) will expel atrocious policemen. Likewise, if the activists make citizens aware about pollution, the citizens (Jurors) in courts will impose higher fines on pollution causing factories.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">But in a judocratic state, what citizens believe is of no use and so spending time in creating public opinion is a waste. Shaping “public opinion” on a specific issue with hope that it would prevail in election is hopeless, as election is cluttered with 100s of issues.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Also, if an issue, such as pollution-control, can become electoral issue ONLY when at least 20% - 30% population becomes aware of it. Till then effect is zero. But in Jury System, even if 5% - 10% population is aware of that issue, one of the 10-12 Jurors will be aware of that issue and later he can explain it in detail to the other members during discussions. This way, even if activists cover a only small population, it will immediately have a small, but positive, effect in courts.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">So creating public opinion helps ONLY in a Juritarian Country. In a judocratic state, it is a waste of</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">time.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.5"><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">How judge system gradually kills Democracy</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Historically speaking, one can see that judge system gradually kills the democracy and replaces it with oligarchy and may eventually become a monarchy.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Once upon a time, most countries were republics and democracies. The sovereignty lied in citizens, not in the kings/judges. The kings/judges were supposed to act according to the will and wish of citizens, not the other way round. But absence of Jury System allowed the kings/judges to bypass citizen’s will on small disputes. The kings/judges used several dispute to increase their personal powers and demean citizens’ opinions. The judges/kings used dispute-resolution as a tool to steal the administrative power from citizens into their own hands. Gradually kings/judges became absolute on the officers.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">I request the reader to note that judges/kings could use dispute-resolution to overcome citizen’s will as there was a procedural flaw in the dispute-resolution mechanism. The king/judge was supposed to resolve the dispute as per laws made by citizens, but the procedure did not actually/physically involve citizens or a randomly chosen sample. The Jury System cures this flaw in a very inexpensive way.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.6"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">For the poor, Jury System is MORE effective democracy than elections</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Lets take a situation where handful of landlords, mine-owners etc are likely to abuse lakhs of poors. In such a situation, say the poors elect 100-200 leaders (MLAs, MPs) who have power to control the rich and to reduce the abuses. The pitfall is - once elected, the leaders will sell themselves in 1-2 years and would rather join the rich instead of controlling them. This has been the story for past 5000 years.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In contrast, the Jury is more effective way. Say for each instance of abuse, there is a Jury Trial. Then there will soon be lakhs of Trials and it will involve lakhs of Jurors. The handful of rich, in order to bribe so many Jurors will have to delegate the tasks to juniors and the juniors would NOT deliver most of the bribes. Due to this operational difficulties, the rich will fail to bribe Jurors in most cases. Thus poor are better of with Jurors, than few elected leaders who will eventually sell out.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The fact that leaders are small in number and Jurors will be large in number makes a difference.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.7"><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Can election system continue without Jury System?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The biggest threat elections are from military uprisings. It turns out,</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: left;">empirically speaking, Juritarian Nations have better track record of avoiding military rules. While in judocratic states, sooner or later, military increases its role and finally overthrow the elected heads.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Here are reasons why elected heads often get overthrown by military heads in judocratic states.</p><ol id="l12"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">The rank and file of officers are not elected but appointed.</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">It is impossible for a few hundred  elected heads to discipline lakhs of officers/policemen. Disciplining them needs examining them on a case by case basis and then deciding appropriate punishments. This can be done ONLY by courts and not by Assemblies, Parliaments and Panchayats.</p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In all the countries in this Universe, the judges fail to control corruption of officers and white-collar crimes of rich (such as tax-evasion, black economy, illegal wealth accumulation etc.). In many cases, such money related crimes give rise to more and more crimes and increase in police-atrocity. In short, in a country with judge system, crime, corruption and atrocity become commonplace</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">As a result, citizens start loosing faith in courts and elected-heads and start paying the ganglords for protection and justice.</p></li></ol><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">So the chaos and need for brutal force increases. It gives need and opportunities for military heads to take over The anti-Jury judges have somehow assumed that they do not need citizens to save themselves from</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">military heads. Well, the hammer is NOT more powerful than a gun, unless millions of citizens have respect for that hammer. In Juritarian Countries, the hammer is backed by Jurors (i.e. citizens) and so it has citizens’ support in general. In a judocratic state, the hammer of the judge sooner or later looses citizens’ support and military-heads do not fear from it.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Now in Juritarian Countries, there have been some small periods of military rules. But in these period, the military did not control the rank and file of the administration - much of the administration was left to the civil institutions. The military rulers of these Juritarian Countries prepared a ground for stability, a new constitution and readily gave up their powers without bloodshed.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Here is a list of countries where there have been elections, but sooner or later the elected heads got overthrown by military leaders.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">Taiwan, South Korea Malaysia</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Mexico, Philippines, Egypt, Turkey, Iran, Thailand, Congo, Colombia, Argentina, Tanzania, Sudan, Kenya, Morocco, Peru, Nepal, Venezuela, Uganda,  Mozambique, Syria, Cote d&#39;Ivoire, Madagascar, Cameroon, Ecuador, Guatemala, Zimbabwe, Angola, Niger, Tunisia, Zambia, Dominican Rep, Chad, Bolivia, Guinea, Honduras, El Salvador, Paraguay, Jordan, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and many more...</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Theoretically, election is macro-democracy and Jury System is micro-democracy. Just as a huge building needs 1000s of iron rods for its support, for effective results of the macro-democratic processes, the nation needs lakhs of micro-democratic legs. The Jury System provides these million micro-democratic legs. But in contrast, the judge-system is micro-dictatorship. And sooner or later, it replaces macro-democracy (elections) with a macro-dictatorship (i.e. military rule)</p></li><li data-list-text="3.8"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Can judges protect democracy from Military rule or foreign invasion?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The judges who are ready to oppose the elected leaders become cowards when military leaders or foreign rulers take over. For example, in Pakistan, very few judges ever challenged military rules. In India, this</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">can be seen by the extent to which judges surrendered before Indira Gandhi during Emergency (1975 - 1977). Few judges opposed the gunda-rule of Sanjay Gandhi . No judge (to my knowledge) issued summons against Sanjay or his youth congress goondas during emergency.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The low-profile of judges in emergency is sufficient to break the myth of “judicial bravery”. A supreme court judge even accepted that : policemen have “right” to shoot anyone during emergency without trial ; and citizens in such cases have no right to complain before a judge ; and he expressed “diamond hope” that that policemen will not be misuse such absolute power !!! Is this a “diamond-hope” or “diamond-cowardice”? The judge in reality was scared that Indira Gandhi may ruin his career or Sanjay Gandhi, with his hooligans, may beat him up at his home or right in the courtroom. But instead of admitting this fear, he expressed a “diamond-hope”. One needs some fearlessness to publicly admit fear. The judge did not even have this basic fearlessness. Had he admitted this fear, he would have done a great favor to citizens by crushing the illusion that judges can protect citizens, and this case citizens would have started looking for alternatives.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">My point is - judges cannot protect citizens from atrocity of military-heads, despotic elected heads and foreigners. So citizens should not keep much hopes in judges when it comes to protecting democracy from the real danger.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.9"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">How are existing Indian judges gradually lessening the democracy</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In 1992, the judges “stole” (I repeat, “stole”) the power of appointing judges from PM into the hands of existing judges. This is the beginning of the end of the republic. By all means, today judges are more, or at least equally, powerful to PM and Cabinet Ministers. The republic means that head of the state is directly/indirectly elected by citizens. Till 1980s, the PM was the head of the state. In the name of PILs, the judges took some of the powers of Executive as they too became alternate heads of the state. But since the judges were appointed by PM, India was still a republic. But in 1992, when judges decided that only judges will appoint/select new judges, it was a partial death of the republic.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Since then, judges are assuming powers to appoint seniors in quasi-judicial commissions. This way, judges in India are lessening the democratic process at the top.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.10"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">“Author vs Professor” and “We, the People vs They, the judges”</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The judge system and democracy contradict each other like day and night, positive and negative and good and evil. Here is another contradiction in judge system.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The Constitution and Laws are written by MPs/MLAs, on behalf of citizens. The Laws are NOT written by judges. The Constitution of India clearly says “We, the people …”, it DOES NOT say “We, the judges ….” But when it comes to interpretation, the judges claim that they are the ones who know what MPs/MLAs/citizens wrote in the law book. And also, when it comes to deciding “intent behind the laws”, the judges should decide, not the MPs/MLAs/citizens.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Now the ridiculous part is “intent behind the law/Constitution.” A document is as dead as a table or a chair. Can a chair have “intention”? No. Only the creator or user of the chair can have intention. The intention lies in human mind, NOT in the document. Thus what can “intent behind an Act mean?” Only meaningful</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">meaning it can have is “intention of law-makers or citizens’. Thus effectively when judges say that they will decide the intent behind the laws, it means “judge will decide about the intentions of law-makers and citizens”.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">This claim is as ridiculous as saying --- a professor in literature knows what an author wrote, not the author himself. And the literature professor is better person to decide the intent of the author, not the author himself. To me, no one can decide anyone intent and no one can understand. The experts claim that they understand citizens, but most of them would have miserably failed to understand their own wives and children and parents and colleagues with whom they have spent years and years. And somehow these experts can understand citizens!!!</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Now “deciding intent of law-maker and citizens” is also confusing in itself. The Constitution of India was written in 1950 and most of the adult citizens who were there in 1950 have passed away. And the judges who were in Supreme Court in 1950s too have passed away. In that case, who will decide the “intention of law-makers and citizens of 1950?” By all means, the citizenry has more continuity than Parliament and judocracy. And thus the best to decide the intention of “We, the People”, is by calling a Jury.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In short, if the spirit of the Preamble of the Most Precious Document of India is upheld over the petty interests of judges and judocracy, “We, the People” are the writers of the Constitution, NOT “they, the judges”. So if the intention behind the Constitution is to be decided, “We, the People” should decide, not “they, the judges”.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">And thus judges should be replaced by Jurors.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.11"><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">An unavoidable outcome of judge system - Hon’ble Justice M.

Recently, judges in National courts ordered policemen and officers to evacuate 1000s of pollution causing industrial units out of Delhi within a short span of few weeks. First of all, even in spirit it was NOT a good decision. If the pollution causing units go out of Delhi, they will cause pollution elsewhere. Loot Peter to pay Paul? Pollute UP/Haryana to clean Delhi? Are citizens of UP/Haryana second-class citizens? The judges should have abolished pollution-causing methods, not merely relocate the units.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: left;">And such abolition/re-location has to be done on a case-by-case basis. It needs 1000s of micro-surgeries spread over a decade, not a few amputation within weeks. The blanket decision of judges was a surgery by sword. Now case-by-case decisions cannot be done in National court as National court does not have 1000s of judges to handle so many cases. The matter should have been left to lower courts consisting of Jurors, who can deal with units on a case by case basis. The National court is not a place to deal with so many individual units. By ordering eviction of 1000s of units, the National court judges have violated Natural Law that eviction should not be ordered without giving the owner a hearing.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The decision is a repeat of history, when judge Mohammed Bin Tughalak  (in his time, title of judge was Sultan) had ordered to shift entire Delhi. How could Hon’ble Chief Justice of Hindustan Mr. Tughalak take and force such a decision which potentially ruined the lives of millions of citizens and wrecked the nation? Because he and his appointed judges/officers had power to evict/punish citizens without Jury.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Likewise, a judge in Gujarat State court, named B. C. Patel,  ordered municipality officers to cut off gutter connections of several buildings. In 1-2 days, the sewer pipes overflowed and the entire area became a pond of dirty water. Still not satisfied, the same judge also ordered electricity company to cut-off electricity connections in 40-50 buildings where about 50000 citizens were residing. Reason? Some minor fire-safety related construction violations in those buildings. That too, violations were done by the builders 10-15 years ago and the residents were not at all responsible. The electricity company officers, being afraid of contempt of judge related laws, had no option but to cut the connection thereby plunging some 50000 residents into darkness. Within hours there was a riot. Finally the police commissioner rightfully decided not to use brutal force against citizens but to disrespect the judge’s Tughalaki order. The police commissioner told the electricity company to restore the connections. The irony is that even though the police commissioner took the right step by disrespecting such a judge and restoring the connections, a judge may throw him into prison for the contempt.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In contrast, no Jury would have taken such a Tughalaki step of cutting electricity connections of residents for such technical violations done by builders 10-15 years ago. If  the history repeats itself, best example is that judge system repeats Tughalaks. Without Jury System, democracy may or may not remain on paper, but each and every (I repeat, each and every) evil of Tughlakism will appear in the citizens’ lives.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l13"><li data-list-text="4."><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -23pt;text-align: justify;">Empirical evidences support Jury System and go against judge system</p><ol id="l14"><li data-list-text="4.1"><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Most and least corrupt countries</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">To show that Jury System is superior to judocracy, and to show Jury System more effective than judge system in checking corruption/atrocity of officers/policemen, I would give brief details of some of the countries.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 156%;text-align: justify;">Transparency International is “NGOs’ favorite”.

In most rural areas, respect for laws by official agencies is nearly nonexistent, and in general, lower courts and law enforcement are undermined by widespread bribery. …</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Europeans started settling into US and Mexico around 1500 AD. Mexico in 1800 was much larger than what it is today. About 4 states of US, namely Texas, California, Arizona and New Mexico were part of Mexico in 1800. Since Spain did not have Jury System, the Spain’s administration in Mexico too did not install Jury System. There were a few attempts to establish Jury System, but they were crushed. In 1810, Mexico became independent, but Spain was able to crush the rebels. The rebels fought again and by 1820 Mexico was fully independent. Thus Mexico was only 35-45 years behind US in obtaining independence.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In US, the law required that an officer must convince a Jury before the judge can announce a prison sentence. Likewise, suppose there are evidences of corruption against an officer, the Jurors can send that officer to prison even against the wish of the judge. As a result, so called “Inspector Raj” was not there in US. While in Mexico, the judge’s approval was sufficient to throw citizens into prison. And officers developed nexus with judges to ensure that judges will not punish even if they are caught red-handed with corruption. As a result, since the beginning, Inspector Raj type regime came into existence.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">As a result, Mexico’s economy has always been down. Tired of despotism, some people in Texas, California and Arizona revolted and asked for secession and decided to merge with US. This resulted into war between US and Mexico. Mexico lost and by 1850 Texas, California and Arizona became states of US.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Today, Mexico too is a capitalist country. It is quite wealthy in terms of per capita income and natural resources. Yet lakhs of Mexicans cross borders and work in US farms for mere $7 - $8 for a 10-12 hour day. This salary is absolutely meager in US, where legal minimum wage is $50 for a 10-hour day. The reason - in Mexico they do not even get $2 - $3 per day.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Except for few years of military rules, elections in Mexico are quite regular. Like US, Mexico has Presidential System. Like US, the Supreme Court judges are all powerful and have powers to imprison corrupt officers/Ministers. But the judges seldom use their powers to discipline the corrupt officers. Instead, they use it only to extract bribes.</p></li><li data-list-text="4.3"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Argentina - another classic failure of judge system</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Argentina is another country which uses judge system to resolve disputes. In 1800 AD, Argentina was more prosperous than US. The country became independent  in 1816. Interrupted by some military rules, regular elections have been held since 1816. The reason why military was able to take over is because the judges had failed to control corruption of officers/Ministers. Argentina has been a hallmark of capitalism - even the water distribution inside cities is via private companies.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The judges in Argentina, like all other countries that have judge system, have all the powers needed to punish corrupt/atrocious policemen/officers/MPs/Ministers. But in past 180 years after independence, the judges have been total failure in providing protection to citizens from lower ranks of policemen. Since 1810, the entrepreneurs and small farmers are constantly harassed by government officers and they have no options but to pay them hefty bribes. Many left and decided to settle in US where harassment of officers is negligible. The complete privatization of utilities such as electricity, water supply, telephones etc. has reduced corruption, but extremely heavy profiteering has overall created a much higher burden on the citizens.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">All in all, the judges in Argentina have been total failures.</p></li><li data-list-text="4.4"><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Conclusions</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The empirical evidences, such as list of countries, are not sufficient, but then, entire field of sociology and political science is based on nothing but empirical evidences. Whatever may be the limitations of empirical evidences, what is fact that empirical evidences do not support culture theory or any other political structure but support the religion of “Jurism” (i.e. corruption/atrocity can reduce ONLY by Jury System).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="5."><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -23pt;text-align: left;">Empirical evidences support “Jurism”, not political-culture/moral-values theories</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">[ A prevailing view amongst academicians of Political Science is that state of affairs of a country depends on its political culture, not on its administrative procedures.

But they have grossly failed to observe that humans in 22 Juritarian Countries (US, UK, New Zealand etc) are no different. The sociologists have also failed to realize that using imperfect humans, these Juritarian Countries have made reasonably good administrative/judicial system using Jury as a basic building block.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In this chapter, I will show that difference between “east and west” is due to Jury System, not due to abstract factors like political culture.</p></li><li data-list-text="5.2"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;">Examples against the belief that “political culture is responsible for corruption”</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: left;">I will show a few cases, where populations have identical cultures and political culture, and yet there a huge gap in level of corruption.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Comparison of (Texas + Arizona + California) and Mexico</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Mexico was ruled by Spain till 1810. In 1810, Mexico became an independent country and since 1820 it has been a democracy with elections but no Jury. Texas, Arizona and California were parts of Mexico till 1850. Around 1850 they seceded from Mexico and became part of US.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Now (Texas + Arizona + California) and Mexico had same culture, same administration and same political system from 1500 to 1850. Even today, in southern Texas, California, and Arizona the population is culturally/ethnically same as population of Mexico i.e. Hispanic. In spite of all these ethnic/cultural similarities, Texas NEVER had rampant corruption in policemen/officers/judges/Ministers since 1850 and Mexico never had  non-corrupt  policemen/officers/judges/Ministers  since  1850.  Two  regions  have  identical ethnicity/culture/language, and yet officers/policemen/judges behave differently.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Comparison of pre-Jury France and Juritarian France</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: left;">The culture and political culture theories fail when one sees difference between France before 1850 and France after 1850. Full Jury System came in France in 1850 and it took about 5-10 to stabilize. The France was</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: left;">-plagued with police atrocity problem from 1400 to till 1850 and by 1860, the police atrocities has by and large disappeared. Change of so many policemen’s moral values in just a decade? Or did system make a difference? <u>Comparison of (US + Canada) and (Mexico + Argentina + Columbia + … of 1800 AD)</u></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Another example is (US + Canada) vs (Mexico + Argentina + Columbia + all other South American countries). All these countries have similar past - Europeans from various nations came and started settling around 1600 AD. Though US was first to become independent (1776 AD), other countries were not much behind. Mexico got independence in 1810-20 and Brazil, Columbia, Argentina etc. got independence in 1840s. US and Canada had more French/English/German nationals while Mexico etc. had more Spanish/Portuguese nationals. But each of these countries were basically a mix of all European nationalities. All countries had been democratic in the beginning. The only distinguishing feature in their legal/political system was Jury System.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Only Canada and US had Jury System while all other countries had judge system. The countries with judge system soon became victim of rampant corruption from top to bottom. In all countries with judge systems, judges absolutely failed to control corruption of Presidents, Ministers, elected MPs/MLAs, officers, policemen and judges. They became so corrupt that citizens lost faith in elections altogether making way for military dictators. While in both countries with Jury System (US +Canada) elections has survived.</p></li><li data-list-text="5.3"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Conclusions</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">What is responsible for corruption/atrocity in a nation? - the nation’s political culture or its citizens’ moral values or the nation’s court system?</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">A better question is : say two nations have significant difference in the levels of corruption/atrocity.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Then what factors are responsible for the differences?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Human-nature, moral-values etc. are super-abstract unobservable unverifiable super-micro entities. National-character, political-culture etc.  are super-abstract unobservable unidentifiable unverifiable super-macro entities. In contrast, court system is neither micro not macro, is not abstract and can be easily observed and verified. Proving that difference between two nations by human nature, moral value, national character etc is mostly a one line proof and matter of faith. While proving that difference in nations is due to difference in <i>the way discretion is distributed </i>in 2 nations is a difficult task.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Now I would give my answer to a 5000 year old unresolved question - who is more responsible for corruption ?   a)political culture, national character etc.  OR  b)human nature, moral values etc.  OR c)administrative/court system</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">My answer is - corruption/atrocity is ONLY because administrative/court system gives too much opportunity to officers to act in their own ways and the same administrative/court system gives too little opportunity to common citizens or victims to expel/punish such officers<span class="p">. The flaw is of system and system only. Human-nature,  moral  values,  national  character,  political  culture,  historical  determinism,  economic determinism, historical roots, pre-historical roots etc. are useless concepts.

The economy survives mainly on export of raw materials, natural resources and transfer payments. Technologically, these 45 countries are not making any significant progress. In each country, the crime is high and there are kidnapping and extortions. In Indonesia, the living standard of bottom 50% of population has gone down in past 20 years and some of them live in extreme poverty though country is wealthy in terms of per capita natural resources.

And so does detailed examination of economic and legal system of each of these countries. I studied US, UK Germany, Sweden, Mexico, India, Japan, USSR and Russia, China and Argentina in more detail.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">If one dissects capitalism in France, Germany, Sweden etc. these countries have huge public sectors. There has been some complaint of wastage and inefficiency, but there has been no complaints of corruption. And overall performance of public sector was good<i>. So our complaint in India that public sector is corrupt is true, but reason is NOT government ownership</i>. If that was the case, the public sector in Germany, Sweden too should have been at least partly corrupt. But the reason why public sector in India is corrupt is due to failure of judges to punish the corrupt. And in France, Germany, Sweden etc. public sector worked so well was because Juries punished the corrupt officers thereby keeping corruption under control.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The pro-capitalist folks are, academically speaking, dishonest. When they present the case in favor of capitalism/liberalization, they only present the 20-25 successful countries and conveniently ignore the 45-50 failures.  Further, many say that capitalism will automatically give rise to politically more liberal and more democratic regime. But 150-180 years of capitalism in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Panama, Columbia and several other countries has not created good regimes.</p></li><li data-list-text="6.5"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">How Jury System assists economic progress and how judge system destroys it</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In each country, be capitalist or communist or mixed economy, the reason why economic progress occurred or stumbled was as follow :</p><ol id="l18"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Economic/technological innovation is initially made a solo individual or a small group of individuals. They could be private or inside a state owned corporation. Due to their efforts, they acquire some money and/or prestige.</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Moment these small upcoming individuals make some progress, the established folks try to take over their fame/money. For example, moment an entrepreneur in India, Mexico etc. earns some money, the news will spread and various inspectors from Sales Tax, Income Tax, Fire Safety, Excise, Customs, Police etc. will come like adopted sons and ask for a bribe. In government owned or private corporations, moment an engineer makes an innovation, a battery of officers/executive will gather to take credit of that innovation. In the round one, small guys will loose and will have to go to courts to win back.</p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In Juritarian Countries like US/UK/Germany/Sweden the solo individuals went to court to protect their wealth/fame. And Juries protected them from the powerful scavengers. And so the common individuals were motivated. While in judocratic countries, the private entrepreneurs and motivated public sectors employees too went to court to protect their wealth/name, but judges gave them nothing but frustration.</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Also when established officers tried to extract bribes from small businessmen, the Juries were prompt at expelling the officers from the government. While judges were seldom prompt, had nexuses with officers/lawyers, and after money changing hands, the judges declared those officers innocent. As a result, the small businessmen/industrialists suffered a retardation in judocratic countries.</p></li><li data-list-text="5."><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Likewise when an established officer tried to put his name on a innovation done by a state owned company, the Jurors were prompt at expelling that established person. While the judges, once again due to age old nexus with lawyers and officers, only gave frustration to the small guy.</p></li></ol><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">So in short, Juries protect the small guys and so nation progresses. While judges always end up taking sides of biggies who trample the upcoming small guys, and so the nation does not progress. It is not a rocket science to see why only nations with Jury System progresses.</p></li><li data-list-text="6.6"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">India : has liberalization succeeded or failed?</p></li></ol></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The chapter is to show that root of success was Jury System NOT capitalism. I gave overview of several countries. Now I will try to show that so called capitalism/liberalization is failing in India, as the gains are cancelled by rising crimes and corruption.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In 1990-2000, there had been a phenomenal increase in crimes such as kidnapping and extortions. Corruption  in officers/judges/Ministers has increased rampantly and administration has been making one blunder after another. Lately (Nov 2000), it is clear that judges want to use weapon of PILs only for rich against poor, and thus no one can have much hope from activist-judges anymore. The rising corruption in Panchayat Members proves that Panchayati Raj is also hopeless concept. All this prove that liberalization/capitalism has COMPLETELY failed to improve political/legal situation in India.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Has liberalization/capitalism improved economy? The situation of top 10% has certainly improved. But that of bottom 70% has worsened. The food and cloth situation is better. But on every other commodity, their consumption is declining. The percentage population living in slums has been steadily increasing since 1990. The suicides amongst farmers is rising and lakhs of farmers are selling their land. A small farmer will sell land only when he is totally bankrupt otherwise. The fact that lakhs of farmers are selling their land proved that their economic situation is worsening. Thus except food and clothes, the bottom 70% has seen no upliftment. All this prove that liberalization/capitalism has failed to improve economic situation of lower 70% in India.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Also, some gains in telecommunication, agriculture etc. are due to technology and NOT due to new economic policies.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The pro-capitalism economist say that capitalism/liberalization would improve their conditions in “near” future. Like Indian judges, Indian economists make next date after next date. Given that</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: left;">capitalism/liberalization has been failing in over 45 countries for past 150 years in every dimension, I don’t have any hopes that capitalism/liberalization will succeed in India.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: left;">All in all, it is useless to waste time in modifying the economic policies. The wheel is stuck in the courtrooms, not in the economy. The Jury System looks more promising than both, liberalization does not.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l19"><li data-list-text="7."><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -23pt;text-align: justify;">Industrial Revolution, Inspector raj and Jury System</p><ol id="l20"><li data-list-text="7.1"><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">The lords’ raj of Europe(1500-1800 AD)</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">All countries in Europe had scientists, engineers and technicians. But only Britain could move ahead into an age of full fledged industry. Amongst several factors, Jury System played the most important role in protecting initial entrepreneurs/industrialists from the clutches of feudal lords.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Everywhere in Europe, the small industrialists were harassed by feudal lords, who saw these early industrialists as competitors. In addition, many initial industrialists were basically lower class technicians against whom the lords had utter contempt. When these industrialists made profits, they immediately started asking for respect and more powers. The feudal lords all over the Europe tried their best to hurt these industrialists. And they succeeded almost everywhere except Britain.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In Britain, due to Jury System, it was NOT possible to fine/imprison a person without permission of citizens. But citizens were getting sound benefits from the creations of these industrialists. The industrialists provided employment, goods, means of transportation and a better life. So in most cases,  the lords fail to convince citizens that industrialists were criminals.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">So the industrialists in Britain got protection against direct onslaught of lords. But in other country, the lord could simply go ahead and arrest the industrialist, shut down his factory and seize his goods. The industrialist So for a long time, even though technology and talent was everywhere in the Europe, the industries came up only in Britain.</p></li><li data-list-text="7.2"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">The inspector-Minister-judge raj of today’s India</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: justify;">So called inspector raj is an incomplete name, as inspectors could not have possibly gone to such an extent without blessings of Ministers and judges. So it is unfair to give all the discredit to inspectors for this raj. Therefore I would refer to “inspector raj” as “inspector-Minister-judge raj”.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 38pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Today, India is facing a problem similar to lord’s raj of 1500-1800 Europe. The inspectors, Ministers, judges etc. are none but the lords. A small industrialist have to go through routine harassment from them. For example, today an inspector/commissioner can walk into a factory and ask for a bribe. Complaining before a judge is a joke. If the small industrialist refuses to pay the bribe, the inspector/commissioner can easily find excuses and shut his factory for few weeks. In contrast, in Jury System, the inspector will have to convince Jurors before he can lock the factory. Now most citizens see most industrialist as an asset as he generates jobs,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: left;">goods and services. Unless the offence is gravely injurious to the society, the Jurors would not approve a shutdown.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In judge system in India, the small industrialist will have to approach a judge in High court to fight against an inspector. This will be very expensive for him and lawyers would at least charge Rs 1000 - Rs 5000 per hearing and a typical case would take 10-50 hearings. So a judge’s proceedings are 10-50 times more expensive than bribe. The net result is that an industrialist has to suffer the harassment of inspector-Minister-judges. Further, big industrialists use inspectors-Minister-judges to crush small industrialists. They would pay hefty bribes to inspectors to conduct real/fake raids and would drag him into lower court, then High court and then Supreme court for tiny reasons. And judges would keep giving dates after dates and finally, the small industrialists would collapse.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The only known cure to this evil of inspector-Minister-judge raj is Jury System.</p></li><li data-list-text="7.3"><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Why Britishers discontinued Jury System?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">One reason I discussed earlier was that Jurors were declaring freedom fighters innocent. Another reason was that Britishers wanted to shut down many budding Indian industrialists, and Juries were not allowing to do so. Lets say for example, an Indian industrialist starts a mill. This will reduce imports from UK and thus reduce the profits of mills in UK. The owners of UK’s mills would approach the Viceroy, who would ask the Collector to shut down the factory and punish the Indian mill-owner. But in Jury System, such step would need approval of Jurors who are common citizens. Now even if common citizens dislike the mill-owner as a person, they would not approve shut down of mill as the mill is something that provides wealth, employment and livelihood to 100s of poors. Thus Britishers were failing in shutting down the industries.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Also, a favorite past time of Britishers was to confiscate the land of a poor farmer who fails to pay taxes during a bad season. The Jury System requires permission of Jurors before confiscation. In most cases, Jurors disapprove confiscation of property of a small-time person. Also, in Jury System it became possible for citizens to punish policemen accused of atrocity. This made policemen reluctant to commit atrocities. The Britishers badly needed police-atrocities to sustain their rule..</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In short, by bringing Jury System in India, the Britishers must have realized the 700 year old fact that organized exploitation is very difficult in Jury System and judges are must for exploiting citizens, as a judge can be easily convinced to allow state/rich sponsored robberies on common citizens, but the Jurors will not approve robberies in most cases.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="8."><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -23pt;text-align: left;">Statesmen’s views on Jury System and judge system</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: left;">I tried my best to search Indian analysts’ views on Jury System. But I could not find even a single article written by an Indian law professor, lawyer, retired lawyer, law-expert, academician, retired judge etc. in</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">favor or against Jury System. It is clear that Indian law-experts, academicians etc have completely ignored Jury System as if it does not exist and NEVER even considered it as an option.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">So all the quotes I have are from US/European statesmen.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: justify;">As I present these quotes, I would request the reader to keep in mind that Jury System is NOT a western method, but is 100% Vedic. And likewise, judge-system of choosing dispute-resolver too is NOT western but Manuvadi. I derived my knowledge about Jury System from the Panch System stated in The Arthavaved. The only reason why I am quoting US/European statesmen is that NO modern Indian leader/academician have written even one line on Jury System.</p><ol id="l21"><li data-list-text="8.1"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Tom on “Jurors vs. judges”</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">For those who do not know, Thomas Jefferson (aka Thomas aka Tom) was the one of the founding fathers of US, who led the was against British in 1776 AD. After independence he became Governor of State of Virginia and in 1792, he became President of USA.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Thomas’s views on judges and Jurors are worth noting. Before independence, Thomas had lots of faith in judges. And after independence, when he had first hand experience with judges, he compared them with “thieves who encroach more and more power”. As he aged and matured, he was loosing faith in judges and asserting more and more and more and more on Jurors.

A trial by such a tribunal is, therefore, in effect, &quot;a trial by the country.&quot; In its results it probably comes as near to a trial by the whole country, as any trial that it is practicable to have, without too great inconvenience and expense.</p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">It is said that it would be absurd that twelve ignorant men should have power to judge of the law, … One answer to this objection is, that the powers of juries are not granted to them on the supposition that they know the law better than the judges; but on the ground that the judges are untrustworthy, that they are exposed to bribes, are themselves fond of power and authority, and are also the dependent and subservient creatures of the legislature; and that to allow them to dictate the law, would not only expose the rights of parties to be sold for money, but would be equivalent to surrendering all the property, liberty, and rights of the people, unreservedly into the hands of arbitrary power, (the legislature,) to be disposed of at its pleasure. The powers of juries, therefore, not only place a curb upon the powers of legislators and judges, but imply also an imputation upon their integrity and trustworthiness.</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Legislators and judges are necessarily exposed to all the temptations of money, fame, and power, to induce them to disregard justice between parties, and sell the rights, and violate the liberties of the people. Jurors, on the other hand, are exposed to none of these temptations. Jurors are not liable to bribery, for they are unknown to the parties until they come into the jury-box. They can rarely gain either fame, power, or money, by giving erroneous decisions. Their offices are temporary, and they know that when they shall have executed them, they must return to the people, to hold all their own rights in life subject to the liability of such judgments, by their successors, as they themselves have given an example for. The laws of human nature do not permit the supposition that twelve men, taken by lot from the mass of the people, and acting under such circumstances, will all prove dishonest. It is a supposable case that they may not be sufficiently enlightened to know and do their whole duty, in all cases whatsoever; but that they should all prove dishonest, is not within the range of probability.</p></li><li data-list-text="5."><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">A jury insures to us what no other court does that first and indispensable requisite in a judicial tribunal : integrity.</p></li><li data-list-text="6."><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">..

That answer is this: Legitimate government can be formed only by the voluntary association of all who contribute to its support. As a voluntary association, it can have for its objects only those things in which the members of the association are all agreed. If, therefore, there be any justice, in regard to which all the parties to the government are not agreed, the objects of the association do not extend to it.</p></li><li data-list-text="7."><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">From one judge learn the characters of all.</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Spooner’s essay also gives history of Jury System, how Jury System has checked corruption and despotism and how elite-members all across Europe have tried to kill it ever since it came into existence.</p></li><li data-list-text="8.3"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Reeve’s History of the English Law</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: justify;">The great court for civil business was the county court; held once every four weeks.

Each one agrees that judges and officers appointed by them should rule, not the citizens.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Gandhi, Hitler, Stalin, Nehru, Sardar etc. would fiercely disagree on the nature of judges. Gandhi would like an anti-untouchability, pro-varnashram, pro-small-industry, anti-large-industry judge. Stalin would like a pro-labor pro-poor pro-state, anti-rich judge. Hitler would favor anti-Jew, anti-labor, anti-poor, pro-rich, pro-owner judge. Nehru’s choice can be seen from the type of judges he used to appoint. But EACH would agree that ONLY the judges appointed by them should rule, and Juries (citizens) should have zero power in the courts.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In practice, as far as legal-system goes, differences among Stalin, Gandhi, Hitler etc. are minor. Essentially, each makes himself and the judges all-powerful and citizens completely powerless. In contrast, pro-Jury and anti-judge leaders like Thomas Jefferson etc. strongly favor Jury over judges, there-by making their own power (to appoint judges) less significant. That’s why, I admire Thomasbhai as a true democrat and reject others as anti-democracy of one type or another.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l27"><li data-list-text="9."><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -23pt;text-align: justify;">Why most law “experts” in India ignored Jury System of West?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">I am attributing all the progress, be it in science or industry or quality of life, that 22 Juritarian Nations have judocratic states to the Jury System.

The academicians and law-experts of west have always praised Jury System loudly and clearly. This includes Presidents, Senators, supreme court judges and Law Ministers of US, UK, France etc. It is ONLY the academicians and law-experts of India and other judocratic states ignored the Jury System of the west.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Why? For the best answer, the reader should ask the closest law-expert in his neighborhood. The question one may ask is NOT why academicians etc are pro-Jury or anti-Jury but how come they never bothered to describe the plus and minus points of Jury System so common in all countries which are worth living.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The academicians and law-experts often state that it is their duty to present all the options before the citizens, including the options they dislike. And they have been quite vocal in describing 100s of options such</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">as Presidential System or hire-and-fire type labor laws, privatization etc. But somehow, they have never suggested Jury System as an option against judge system. Even when law-experts compare British/US legal-systems with Indian legal-system and give micro-details like number of judges, salaries of judges, appointment rules, they forget to mention that British/US legal-system is Jury-centric while Indian legal-system is judge-centric. It is interesting that they seldom even wrote anti-Jury articles, as even such articles would make the citizens aware of the Jury System as an option. Oversight, myopia, blindness or a determination to protect the judge system? Determination so strong that citizens must not know about the possible alternatives to the judge system? Whatever maybe the reasons, this silence is deafening.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Further, a question of pro-judge anti-Jury academicians and law-experts is - what plus points do they see in existing judges which convinces that they are 100% incorruptible?</p></li><li data-list-text="9.2"><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">The cells of body and cells of the society</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Now I will try to explain one possible reason why few academicians in India noticed the Jury System of the west - they were “macro-thinkers” and since Juries are micro-structures, they failed to observe them.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">I will explain this reason in details.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">I will start with an analogy. Many thinkers of world who have wondered how human body can do so many complicated functions. Eventually there were two types of explanations. One explanation was based on macro and super-macro entities like soul, consciousness, planetary movements etc. Second type of explanations were based on micro and super-micro entities like organs, tissues, cells, and molecules.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">For the macro-explanations, there are no proofs and so there can never be a wrong a proof. The macro-explanations are short, sweet, elegant, impressive and have all nice features except that they are useless in curing diseases. While the micro-level explanations are very clumsy, have nothing but details, details and more details. Sometimes micro-explanations prove to be incorrect. Micro-explanations have dozens of other inelegant features. But often, if not always, they help in making medicines.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Now a thinker who is interested in a macro-level explanation will always ignore cells even after a cell is shown to him under a microscope. In most cases, he will refuse to even look into microscope. And he will keep refining the macro-explanations in order to make a correct macro-explanation. And each refinement is one level higher than the previous. But for him, micro-entities are simply immaterial. Such thinkers seldom become biologist, but instead take meta-physics, astrology etc. They often have huge following, but can seldom cure diseases.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Likewise, the a thinker who believes in micro-level explanation will try to explain human body’s functioning in terms of organs and organs’ functioning in term of cells. And cells’ functioning in terms of molecules. And the macro-thinker will laugh when micro-thinkers fails to explain molecules’ behavior. The outstanding achievement of micro-thinkers in curing diseases are conveniently ignored, only his failure to explain the behavior of molecules and atoms is considered. In fact, most macro-thinkers do not consider micro-thinkers as thinkers, they merely dismiss them as specialists, scientists, engineers and technicians.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">That was about human body and thinkers who deal with it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Lets see societies and thinkers to think about societies’ functioning and societies work or fail.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Here also, the thinkers form two categories - those who believe that macro entities like political culture, moral values, national characters, history of past 500-5000 years etc. are important ; and those who believe that laws, legal system, available technology, training and events of past 5-10 years are more important.</p></li><li data-list-text="9.3"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">It is not easy to appreciate tiny cells</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Here is my explanations why Indian academicians and law-experts did not see any importance of Jury System of west</p><ol id="l29"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The Juries are like cells of western legal-system and society. There is no single huge Jury which governs the whole nation, but like cells, there are millions of tiny Juries spread all over the country. Like cells, a Jury does a tiny task and then disappears without living a trace. The macro bodies like supreme courts, Parliament, Senate, Cabinet, secretariats, departments, bureaus etc. are huge, have dozens of offices and can be noticed with naked eye. But observing Juries need a sociological microscope i.e. one needs to sit into court for hours and hours and study hundreds of cases. Also, once has to relate the tiny difference that a Jury makes, with a large difference that millions of Juries all over nation makes every year. Many Indian law experts were looking ONLY at the macro-aspects and so could not notice Juries who are like cells.</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Perhaps some academicians and law-experts rigidly believe that ONLY macro-factors matter and micro-factors are unimportant. So they could see judges in supreme court of US, UK etc. and their judgements, the Senators and their laws, the Presidents and their orders but could not see millions of Juries. And even if they saw the million tiny Juries, they did not think that they important due to their belief that only elephants matter, ants don’t.</p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Perhaps some believed that soul is more important than cells and so they could only see the soul (i.e. political culture, national character) and ignored the cells (i.e. millions of Juries)</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Another reason could be Manuvadi attitude that many Indian academicians and law-experts have. The Manuvadies rigidly believe that common people can never make a difference in society, only leaders/experts can. The common men, to a Manuvadi, are cattle while the leader/expert is the master of the herd. The Juries consist of working men; and to a Manuvadi, they are fools. If one assumes that common men are cattle, one can never notice the act of Juries.</p></li><li data-list-text="5."><p style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The Indian academicians who lived in US/UK for years or visited US/UK often had spent most of their time in seminars and debate-clubs. My allegation is that very few had spent time watching Jury Trials in the courts. This was a major difference in my and their way of acquiring “facts”. I believed that the best way to study a society’s facts and functioning was study the court trials, not read the journals and attend seminars. I had always respected article-writers’ as career-oriented individuals and I never trusted the integrity of a career-oriented individual on social/political matters.</p></li><li data-list-text="6."><p style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Many academicians did know the existence of Jury System and the extent to which it can effect a society. My allegation is that they were perhaps worried that the members of elite would discontinue favors and good gestures if the take a pro-Jury anti-judge stand. So they did not even describe the Jury System. And</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">they did not even criticize Jury System, as a criticism would make many youngsters aware that something like Jury System exists. So there was a total silence on this matter - no one would eighter speak in favor or speak in against.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">I would end my anti-academician blasphemy here.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 33pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Whatever may be the reasons, the Indian academicians and law-experts, knowingly or unknowingly have done a huge disservice to the citizens of India by not describing Jury System to them.</p></li><li data-list-text="9.4"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">Faulty explanations by pro-Jury folks</p></li></ol></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The pro-Jury anti-judge folks too had failed to convince the students of political science and students of sociology about plus point of Jury System over the judge system. One reason is perhaps that their explanations too were plagued with macro-level mumbo-jumbo.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">For example, many pro-Jury anti-judge supported Jury System by stating that Juries represent society while the judges represent the elite. This statement is simply wrong. As every man represents his own interests and then his own Hatred. Very few, in this Universe, ever represents interests or Hatred of others. Very few put citizens’ interests over their interest, very few put citizens’ Hatred over their Hatred and very very few put citizens’ interest over their Hatreds.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Likewise many pro-Jury anti-judge folks stated that Jurors come from common population and so they have stronger morality and are less corruptible. This is wrong too. If one looks at list of Ministers and IAS-officers of India in past 20-30 years and goes through their financial past and present, it is clear that Ministers/officers from poor families have been as corrupt as those from rich families, and sometimes those from rich families have been non-corrupt and have done more for poors than those from poor families.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Some pro-Jury folks explained Jury System as “courtroom democracy”. While the phrase sounds nice, but explanation is incomplete as one needs to explain using individual level aspects why Jury System brings more democratic regime and how more democratic regime would bring more technological progress and reduce atrocities. The phrases like “courtroom democracy’, “participatory judiciary” etc are irritating rhetoric to someone looking for a systematic explanation.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The analytical explanation (of strong points of Jury System over judge system) lies in studying the way individuals tend to develop nexuses in judge system and how citizens’ Hatred against criminals/corrupt works in Jury System. Out of dozens and dozens of pro-Jury anti-judge persons I read, I could find only part of this explanation in essay of Lysander Spooner and quotes of Thomas Jefferson.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">But most pro-Jury anti-judge folks’ explanation had nothing but anti-elite rhetoric. Such rhetorical and illogical statements could not convince pro-poor individuals about the merits of Jury System.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l30"><li data-list-text="10."><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -29pt;text-align: left;">Today’s India : Jury System or else …</p><ol id="l31"><li data-list-text="10.1"><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: left;">The judges are busy, but do not want to give up powers</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">It is true that judges are overloaded with work and so they have no time to control officers’ corruption and atrocities. But in that case, judges or retired judges should eighter 1)using PILs or otherwise force Ministers to give more money to courts so that more judges can be appointed or 2)judges should hand over the responsibilities and power to Executive, Legislature or Citizenry.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The Legislature is not capable of resolving crores of disputes. The Executive (i.e. Ministers and officers) are numerous enough to resolve the disputes but are full of nexuses. So perhaps only option left is Citizenry i.e. Jury System. But pro-judge folks are against Jury System as well. So what we have is : the judges have no time to resolve citizens’ problems, nor they want citizens (Jurors) to resolve it.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">This is suicidal situation for the courts of India, and entire India.</p></li><li data-list-text="10.2"><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">Where will judge system end?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Where will India be if the judge system continues?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">It is difficult to say. But in humans’ history of past 2000 years, the nations using judge systems have eventually collapsed and become slaves of some foreign elite. This is because judge system results into more and more unpopular verdicts and finally there is only one to enforce them - weaken the citizenry to the extent that it is easy to enforce any order at will. For example, in India in 300 AD, the judges (judges of those days were called Brahmins) decided to take away weapons from lower caste members so that they cannot revolt. But where does a nation with weak citizenry end up? When Huns, Shakas, Arabs and other Muslims and finally Britishers came, the nation was so weak that it could not even put up a descent fight. In addition, judge system cannot deal with succession problem, and each succession weakens it. In short, more judocratic a nation is, weaker it becomes and finally gets enslaved by a nation which is less judocratic.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Presently India’s judge system is weakening India’s industry, trade, commerce, education, law and order and every field. It will NOT be possible for India to compete against west in any way. It is quite possible that India will collapse and parts will become subservient to Western elites.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The citizens of India must replace judge system by Jury System.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The citizens of India must force/torture their Panchayat Members and Corporators to pass laws to bring Jury System in Panchayats and Corporations. Later, they force/torture their MLAs/MPs to pass laws to bring Jury System in departments of State Governments and Central Government.</p></li><li data-list-text="10.3"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">Conclusion</p></li></ol></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">One’s opinion is the reality, rest of the world is just an illusion</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Whatever I good things I said about Jurors and bad things I said about judges (and very bad things I could not dare to say about judges due to fear of 6 months prison sentence under “contempt of judge” related law), are what I concluded after observing 100s of judge trials, 10s of judges, 100s of Jury Trial and 100s of common men. By all means, this is a small fraction of the world/Universe. But no one can possibly know all the 1000s of judges of India anyway. My experience is similar to the Austrian Counsel (a position similar to Law Minister) who once said “more I see the trials by the judges, more the respect I have for the Trial by Jury.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">Based on a different small sample, it is very much possible to prove the opposite, that judges are better than Jurors. I have personally met dozens of individuals, including many retired judges who said, based on their “small samples”, that common men of India are several times more corrupt than existing judges of lower and higher courts of India, and so the Jury System in India will breed more corruption than existing judge system. Which small sample represents “The Reality”?</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">It does not really matter.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">In the absence of complete information, only the benefit of doubt prevails. Neither pro-Jury anti-judge folks (like me) or anti-Jury pro-judge folks have “complete information”. Forget complete, none of us have information about integrity/competence of even 1% of the existing 10000 Indian judges and none of us have information about integrity/competence of even 0.0001% of the 100 crore citizens (i.e. potential Jurors under Jury System). So the question is - should one give benefit of doubt to the established career judges or should one give benefit of doubt to the citizens? I choose to give benefit of doubt to the citizens, and so I believe that judges should be replaced by Jurors. But pro-judge anti-Jury folks prefer to give benefit of doubt to judges, and so insist that judges’ discretionary power should further increase.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">On the issue of benefit of doubt, only thing that would matter is one’s opinion.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">So in the final analysis, on the judge-Jury issue, like all other issues, one’s opinion is The Reality and rest of the Universe is just an illusion.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 120pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I suggest following addition to the Constitution’s Preamble</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The Citizens create the State and the Legitimacy of the State, not the Representatives, Ministers. officers, judges, taxpayers or this Constitution.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">If a Representative/Minister/officer/judge has legal power in spite of Citizens’ disapproval, it is a theft of State and legal police power. This theft is nothing but raw violence, and it is the worst form of violence. This theft is the biggest cause of other forms of violence. It is immoral and causes gradual decline of the State, Law, Stability and Progress. The Citizens have right to make laws and remove any Representative/officer/judge from his position any moment, before the completion of his term if the need be.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">And a right is of no use without prompt procedures to fulfil that right.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">The sovereignty of India lies in the Citizens of India, NOT in the MPs, MLAs, Ministers, officers, judges or taxpayers. <i>The living Citizens’ opinions must carry more importance than the dead text of this Constitution and its interpretation by a small group of MPs/judges</i>.
