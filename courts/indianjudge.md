# An Indian judge = judge + part-time prosecutor + part-time police officer

## 1. Over filing FIR / starting case proceedings:

(1.1) If police is not registering FIR or not starting the investigation, the Magistrate can order them to do so

One can directly go to the Magistrate with a complaint of a cognizable offense and the Magistrate can direct the police to register an FIR and investigate the matter.

> Section 156. Police officer's power to investigate cognizable case.
> 
> (1) Any officer in charge of a police station may, without the order of a Magistrate, investigate any cognizable case which a Court having jurisdiction over the local area within the limits of such station would have power to inquire into or try under the provisions of Chapter XIII.
> 
> (2) No proceeding of a police officer in any such case shall at any stage be called in question on the ground that the case was one which such officer was not empowered under this section to investigate.
> 
> (3) Any Magistrate empowered under section 190 may order such an investigation as above- mentioned.

Any Court may, at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code, summon any person as a witness, or examine any person in attendance, though not summoned as a witness, or. recall and re- examine any person already examined; and the Court shall summon and examine or recall and re- examine any such person if his evidence appears to it to be essential to the just decision of the case.”
