</font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">Originally posted by Shalav:<br />You are assuming that a "criminal" will not have the time to bribe a juror. Also that the "criminal" will have to bribe multiple jurors in order to ensure that he gets a favourable verdict. But you ignore the fact that jurors names can be given to the criminal AFTER they have been selected to sit in his particular trial. How do you prevent the juror from being bribed - please don't present procedure - just plainly state how you will prevent a juror from being bribed/cajoled/threatened AFTER his/her selection to sit in judgment in the "criminals" case? </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nothing prevents criminal from approaching Jurors. Sequestering (confining Jurors in Govt guest house with NO phone lines, no visits from relative, a la-prison) from selection till the end of the trial helps, but it is NOT fool proof.<br /><br />But in the Jury System, the criminal has LOT less time to bribe Jurors than time he has to bribe judges in judge system. In The Jury System criminal (accused) has ONLY a few days time, while in judge system, a lawyer has months and years and decades of time to form nexuses.<br /><br />Also, a career criminal has a a gang of 50-100 criminals, and so at a given time, 5-10 trials may be against his gang-members. He has to manage 50-120 Jurors in a short span of 2-10 days. This is far more difficult than managing mere 5-10 judges in a duration of several years.<br /><br />I did NOT say that Jury System is 100% nexus-free. I said that it is LOT less nexus-free than judge system. I am COMPARING  two systems wrt nexus-prone-ness, NOT making any absolute comment on The Jury System.<br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Rahul</b>: The forth lowest number in the series (0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4) is 1. So in the example I gave, punishment will be 1 year. ... <br /><br /><b>Shalav</b> : I am not really sure what you mean. ... </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">The forth lowest number in the SERIES of 12 numbers. Arrange the number in INCREASING order from left to right, and pick 4th number from left.<br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If this is so, why fourth lowest? Why not a majority descision? why should the minority descision be imposed on the accused? Or why not the sixth lowest or the second lowest? It doesn't make sense! </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is accepted principle to give benefit of doubt to the accused. A Jury System which has say 13 members and takes 7th (median) vote as punishment will be Jury System with no benefit of doubt. A Jury System with 12 Jurors which takes LOWEST punishment as punishment would be Jury System with too high benefit of doubt (eg in capital punishment, ALL 12 Jurors must agree. Even one disagreement would mean converting capital punishment into life sentence). <br /><br />Whether it should be 6th lowest vote of 4th lowest vote of 3rd lowest vote in the end  will be decided by the citizens of District/State who pass the Jury Acts by Direct Vote in their States/Districts. <br /><br />My proposal says 4th lowest punishment in Jury of 12 in MOST cases. (In cases of fininacial fine, it is 6th lowest vote, but I would skip the details for now). <br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What if there are only 3 different types of votes?  4,3,0 - with 4 for each descision. which one will be counted.<br /><br />What if there are only 2 different votes 20,0 with 10 voting for 2 and 2 voting for 0 - which number is applicable then? </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am taking the SERIES of 12 numbers. There is NO aggregation.<br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Mr Mehta, the jury system rests on the foundation of conviction based on evidence beyond reasonable doubt. It means that even if there is a reasonable doubt the accused shall be let free, rather than risk a wrong-conviction. It seems you want to overturn this basic foundation of the jury system too. </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">In many states in US, (11 guilty, 1 not-guilty) is conviction.In civil juries (9 guilty, 3 non-guilty) is conviction. In states, which require all 12 guilty, the lawyers of both sides have oppurtunity to exclude potential Jurors out of the randomly chosen citizens (venire). So say 12 people are to be chose, the court will summon say 50. Then prosecution gets oppurtunity to exclude those who may say "not-gulity". The defence will exclude those who they think may say "guilty". But if no one is given chance to exclude people, it would be difficult to get unanimous verdict most of the time.<br /><br />In short, the states which have uninanimity condition has to allow exclusions to avoid hung Juries. My proposal DOES NOT have exclusion, and so I can make uninamity a condition for verdict. <br /><br />So 4th lowest lowest is "in-between" situation. 6th lowest punishment would mean zero benefit of doubt and 1st lowest punishment would mean TOO much benefit of doubt. <br /><br />I am NOT violating any basic prinicple of Jury System. The Jury System is based on ONLY one (hypo)thesis --- that Jurors being large in numbers are less prone to be nexused with criminals compared to judges. Jury System has NO other "basic" principle that I know of.<br /><br />-Rahul Mehta

-Nothing prevents criminal from approaching Jurors. Sequestering (confining Jurors in Govt guest house with NO phone lines, no visits from relative, a la-prison) from selection till the end of the trial helps, but it is NOT fool proof.<br /><br />If not foolproof why change a system for another just as liable to be corrupted?<br /><br />Sequestering has to imply that the trial is conducted in one shot. What if the accused lawyer falls ill AFTER jury selection and requests postponement of the trial. What about the period after the jury selection and before trial commencement. Are you going to keep jurors in gov.t guest houses till the lawyer recovers. What if the criminal bribes the prosecutor to fall it. Waht if the criminal bribes the judge to fall ill? Sequestering only works for short trials, you cannot keep people hanging on for ever waiting for one lawyer or the other to recover.<br /><br />-But in the Jury System, the criminal has LOT less time to bribe Jurors than time he has to bribe judges in judge system. In The Jury System criminal (accused) has ONLY a few days time, while in judge system, a lawyer has months and years and decades of time to form nexuses.<br /><br />So what? If it can be corrupted, then it is no better than the present one. Why not propose changes to the present one instead of throwing the baby with the bathwater ?<br /><br />-Also, a career criminal has a a gang of 50-100 criminals, and so at a given time, 5-10 trials may be against his gang-members. He has to manage 50-120 Jurors in a short span of 2-10 days. This is far more difficult than managing mere 5-10 judges in a duration of several years.<br /><br />So what? He can still corrupt a few jurors as he can corrupt a few judges.<br /><br />-I did NOT say that Jury System is 100% nexus-free. I said that it is LOT less nexus-free than judge system. I am COMPARING two systems wrt nexus-prone-ness, NOT making any absolute comment on The Jury System.<br /><br />So you admit the jury system is just as prone to "nexus-prone-ness" as the judge system? Which brings me back to the original question, why change it at all, instead of improving the current system<br /><br />-The forth lowest number in the SERIES of 12 numbers. Arrange the number in INCREASING order from left to right, and pick 4th number from left.<br /><br />Why increasing order, why not decreasing order? Why the 4th pick, why not the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, or 12th pick?<br /><br />-It is accepted principle to give benefit of doubt to the accused. A Jury System which has say 13 members and takes 7th (median) vote as punishment will be Jury System with no benefit of doubt. A Jury System with 12 Jurors which takes LOWEST punishment as punishment would be Jury System with too high benefit of doubt (eg in capital punishment, ALL 12 Jurors must agree. Even one disagreement would mean converting capital punishment into life sentence).<br /><br />Whats wrong with the benefit of doubt? You are assuming that the accused is guilty even before the jury has reached a verdict, by dismissing any chance for an innocent man to go free with your sequential punishment selection method. <br /><br />-Whether it should be 6th lowest vote of 4th lowest vote of 3rd lowest vote in the end will be decided by the citizens of District/State who pass the Jury Acts by Direct Vote in their States/Districts.<br /><br />Which citizens? What direct vote? What Jury act? Where on Earth do you live?<br /><br />-My proposal says 4th lowest punishment in Jury of 12 in MOST cases. (In cases of fininacial fine, it is 6th lowest vote, but I would skip the details for now).<br /><br />thanks!!       <img border="0" title="" alt="[Big Grin]" src="biggrin.gif" />      <br /><br />-I am taking the SERIES of 12 numbers. There is NO aggregation.<br /><br />Let me put it another way. In a trial by 12 jurors 8 vote for the maximum punishment of 20 years, and 4 vote for no punishment. Therefore if i have understood your system correctly the votes will be as follows<br /><br />0 0 0 0 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20<br /><br />Using the criterion of 4th pick the accused is released, but 3/4 of the jurors thought that the accused deserved greater punishment. Doesn't make sense to me. Relies on number manipulation rather than common sense of the jurors.  <br /><br />-In many states in US, (11 guilty, 1 not-guilty) is conviction.In civil juries (9 guilty, 3 non-guilty) is conviction. In states, which require all 12 guilty, the lawyers of both sides have oppurtunity to exclude potential Jurors out of the randomly chosen citizens (venire). So say 12 people are to be chose, the court will summon say 50. Then prosecution gets oppurtunity to exclude those who may say "not-gulity". The defence will exclude those who they think may say "guilty". But if no one is given chance to exclude people, it would be difficult to get unanimous verdict most of the time.<br /><br />-In short, the states which have uninanimity condition has to allow exclusions to avoid hung Juries. My proposal DOES NOT have exclusion, and so I can make uninamity a condition for verdict.<br /><br />-So 4th lowest lowest is "in-between" situation. 6th lowest punishment would mean zero benefit of doubt and 1st lowest punishment would mean TOO much benefit of doubt.<br /><br />-I am NOT violating any basic prinicple of Jury System. The Jury System is based on ONLY one (hypo)thesis --- that Jurors being large in numbers are less prone to be nexused with criminals compared to judges. Jury System has NO other "basic" principle that I know of.<br /><br />Too much benefit of doubt!       <img border="0" title="" alt="[Eek!]" src="eek.gif" />       For a person who wants to reform the judicial system, you sure dont care much for rights of the accused. You are trying to convolute and fit a square peg into a round hole in order to support principles which shrug off the basic thinking behind jury trials which is a judgement by ones peers, and which if reasonable doubt exists means that the accused is let off, not given a prison term just because some random thinker thought that was is a good idea.

To add to the above.<br /><br />This proposal to pick the 4th, 6th whatever in the series as punishment for a crime introduces randomness in punishment. <br /><br />Firstly what makes a juror competent enough to choose the number of years of incarceration? <br /><br />Secondly - assuming all is well, and there are no outside influences in the jury - it means that the fate of the accused is randomly decided by a pick and choose method. Where is the fairness in this? It goes against all Constituitional norms of  punishment fitting the crime. <br /><br />Of all the schemes I've heard so far, this one really makes me wonder what exactly is in your mind? Are you really concerned about reforming the judicial system, or are you just making up stuff as inconvinient objections are raised.

</font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Rahul</b>  Nothing prevents criminal from approaching Jurors. Sequestering (confining Jurors in Govt guest house with NO phone lines, no visits from relative, a la-prison) from selection till the end of the trial helps, but it is NOT fool proof.<br /><br /><b>Shalav:</b> If not foolproof why change a system for another just as liable to be corrupted? </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">Beuase permanet and fixed judges are FAR FAR more prone to nexuses. There is difference between 10% failure and 99.99% failure. In Jury System, the career criminals will be able to crack say 1000 out 12000 Jurors he confronts every year, and so system will fail say 10% to 20% of the time. While in judge system, a career criminal will crack ALL 5-10 judges he contronts within no time, and system will fail in over 99% case.<br /><br />So reduce failure rate from 99% to 20% (or less), we need to fire judges and bring Jurors onboard.<br /><br /><b>How does past nexuses help in judge system while they fail in Jury System</b><br /><br />Say a career criminal and his gang-members are facing 100 trials in some 2-5 areas. In judge system, all trials will go to some 2-5 judges, while in JurySys they go to SEPERATE 100 Juries of 12 each.<br /><br />Say the criminal has bribes one Jury, and he gets away. But the next case is with DIFFERENT 12 Jurors or <b>the nexuses he made in PAST trials</b> are NOT useful. He needs to start from scratch.<br /><br />While in judge system, say a criminal has bribed a judge to get acquittal. Now in <b>the NEXT trial with same judge, he will have LESS problem </b> than he faced first time. Second time, the amount may remain same, but acquittal will be cake walk and judge and criminal have dealth previously. By 3rd, 4th and 10th or 100th trial, the career criminal would have cultivated dense freindship with the judge.<br /><br />In Jury Syste, the career criminal ha sto start ALL over again in each case. While in judge system, PREVIOUSLY build nexuses work as a CAPITAL investment, and reduce the future costs.<br /><br />In many courts, the criminals dont even have to approach judges on a case by case basis. A monthly payment of say Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh is decided, and that would ensure ALL acquitals of him and his gang-members. Since in the Jury System Jurors change with every trial, no such monthly deal is possible.<br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sequestering has to imply that the trial is conducted in one shot. What if the accused lawyer falls ill AFTER jury selection and requests postponement of the trial. What about the period after the jury selection and before trial commencement. Are you going to keep jurors in govt guest houses till the lawyer recovers. </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">In most Jury Trials, the lawyers are NOT allowed to ask for postponement. If witness doesnt show up, the trial proceeds WITHOUT witness.<br /><br />Same is in judge system. The judge can deny adournment. But reason why judges have to allow it is becuase they are overloaded with work and cant provide continuous trial. <br /><br />   </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What if the criminal bribes the prosecutor to fall it. Waht if the criminal bribes the judge to fall ill? </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">Prosecution is made less corruptible using<br />1)Grand Jury system over prosecution<br />2)Elected prosecutors<br /><br />If public prosecutpor is ill, the admin has to appoint ANOTHER prosecutor in his place. If judge falls ill or dies, another judge will takes his position next day. The show goes on, unless Jurors die. Even then, in most cases, there are 18 Jurors, 12 sitting and 6 stand-by. So unless 7 Jurors are killed, the show will go on.<br /><br />If Public Prosecuto sells out, it is NOT much of a problem. The victim can be allowed to present his own lawyer and cross-examine the witnesses.<br /><br />eg say street criminals are threatening people for monthly-hafta. Say one has video-tape with recordings of threats/beatings. In the procedures I propose, one can DIRECTLY approach Grand Jurors WITHOUT public prosecutor, and get a trial.<br /><br />The toughest problem in courts is that judges form nexuses with criminals/lawyers. The criminal-PP nexus is easy to crack by allowing victims to present the case himself or via his lawyer.<br /><br />   </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sequestering only works for short trials, you cannot keep people hanging on for ever waiting for one lawyer or the other to recover. </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most (over 90%) trials in Jury System get over in 1-2 weeks. And as far as career criminals go, which have the bulk of the problems in India, conviction rate of 5% is sufficient to get them in prison within 6 months. So even if Jury Trials fail in 10% to 95% cases, career crimes will vanish.<br /><br />   </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Rahul</b>: in the Jury System, the criminal has LOT less time to bribe Jurors than time he has to bribe judges in judge system.

One cant corrupt 12000 out of 12000 Jurors. The logistic does not allow that. One can corrupt say 1000 out 12000 Jurors, but that would ensure a fiar trial in at least 70% to 90% cases.

But even then over 80% trials will be nexusless. While in judge system that lawyer will confront AT MOST 5-20 judges, whom he can EASILY manage. so there is will nexused trial in over 99% cases.<br /><br />So even in WORST case, Jury System is at least 80% free from lawyer-Juror nexus. While in BEST case, judge system is 1% to 5% free from judge-lawyer nexus. <br /><br />The difference matters to me.

In judge system, sinc ethe judges get nexused over time, they fail to take care of rights of accused. eg in India, judges kept an accused in prison for 35 years as under-trial prisoner for a charge which if guilty would have resulted into MAX 1-2 years.

Mehtaji;<br /><br />Let me understand this correctly. While you want the justice system to change and provide the US as an example of a succesful justice system, you don't want to follow the same procedures and rules and conventions they follow. Instead you want us to adopt a hotch-potch of the new ideas which negate their advantages. You forget the US system can be presented as successful by you only because of the procedures and rules they have, any changes to suit your theories, will make them prone to failure.<br /><br />I really don't think you have any idea of what a jury system means in principle and how the US and the UK use it. You assign advantages to this system when there are none, and discard its faults by making things up as you go along. All your writings in this issue have failed to convince many people of the advantages of the system, and I don't expect people to be writing to their MLA/MP asking for this to be implemented immediately. Perhaps rather than wasting your time or other peoples with an obsessive compulsive single-minded lecturing about the judges in India, maybe you should take some time off to research and mull over the problems and what the jury system means to the  US / UK in principle and practice. Then come back with fresh ideas of how they can be applicable to India. <br /><br />I've been hearing the same thing for over 2 years now - first in e-charcha, where they banned you / laughed you off their board and now here - there has been the same repititious low-level buzz on and on and on and on... Time for fresh ideas dude - maybe its time for you to tilt at fresh windmills!

<font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">
When the judge is in the dock <br /><br /> <br />T. R. Andhyarujina     <br /><br /> <br />On the golden jubilee of the Supreme Court in January 2000, Chief Justice Anand proudly stated,‘‘It is a matter of pride and satisfaction that the judiciary today enjoys credibility far greater that that enjoyed by the other two wings of the state.’’ A year later, this sense of self-satisfaction was shaken when the succeeding chief justice, S.P. Bharucha, publicly lamented that ‘‘eighty per cent of the judges in the country were honest and incorruptible and the smaller percentage was bringing the entire judiciary into disrepute’’. Between last year and this year, at least eight judges of different high courts have come into prominence for alleged misconduct and impropriety affecting the discharge of their judicial functions. <br /><br />Even if some of these charges are unsubstantiated, their mere airing can shake public confidence in the higher judiciary. Even worse is the impression gaining ground that there is no way of disciplining judges of superior courts. There is then an urgent need to set up a credible machinery to investigate charges against judges. <br /><br />The Constitution framers provided for the removal of Supreme Court and high court judges for proven misbehaviour or incapacity through impeachment by Parliament. When this method was adopted in 1950, the superior judiciary consisted of a cohesive body of seven judges of the Supreme Court and a few judges of five high courts. The makers of our Constitution obviously believed the occasion for the removal of judges of a superior court would be a rare event. Half a century later, conditions are different. There are now 25 judges of the Supreme Court and about 600 of the high courts. The winds of falling standards of public life have not swept past judges of the superior courts without affecting them. In the only instance in which impeachment was tried in 1993, in the case of Justice V. Ramaswamy of the Supreme Court, the method proved cumbersome, dilatory and political. Removal of judges by impeachment is therefore no longer a practical method. <br /><br />In the absence of a legally sanctioned method for disciplining judges of superior courts, extra-constitutional methods have been resorted to. On two occasions, the Bombay Bar took the law in their own hands against judges whose integrity came into question. On the first occasion, they called for the resignation of four judges, and in response the then chief justice of the high court did not assign work to them till they were transferred or retired. On the second occasion, they called for the resignation of the chief justice of the high court, who eventually resigned at the instance of the chief justice. This is a dangerous method as it makes lawyers self-appointed disciplinary authorities over judges. <br /><br />Last year, the chief justice appointed three committees of judges to inquire into allegations of impropriety by judges of three high courts. The result was unsatisfactory as these committees did not have the authority of law to summon evidence and effectively investigate the charges. Even when in some cases the findings were against judges, no action could be taken against them. A convenient way to avoid action against a judge under a cloud has been to transfer him to another high court resulting in protests from the bar of that high court, which understandably does not wants such a judge. <br /><br />As long as the Constitution is not amended to change the method of removal, there cannot be an alternate legal method of their removal. But short of removal of judges of superior courts, there is no reason for not making a law for investigating misconduct of judges and disciplining them. In the US, while the method of removal by impeachment of federal judges by Congress is still considered appropriate, there is a supplemental law — the Judicial Councils Reform and Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980. We can adapt it for our purpose. <br /><br />Under this Act, complaints alleging that a judge ‘‘has engaged in conduct pre-judicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of courts’’ can be made to the chief judge of a Judicial Council of Judges. If the complaint is frivolous it is dismissed. If not, it is investigated by a special committee of judges. Upon receipt of their report, the Judicial Council may, one, direct the judge under investigation to take such action as the Council deems fit. Two, request the judge to retire voluntarily. Three, order that on a temporary basis no further cases should be assigned to him. Four, reprimand such a judge publicly or privately. Five, report the case to the House of Representatives for impeachment. The judge has full opportunity to defend himself and he has a right of review to a Federal Judicial Council whose proceedings are confidential. <br /><br />A similar law must be enacted by the Indian Parliament in consultation with the chief justice. It will provide a legal way to take disciplinary action against judges of superior courts. It will provide protection to the judges against groundless charges and, at the same time, satisfy the lawyers and the public that complaints against judges of superior courts are investigated by a credible machinery. It will also largely solve the problem of bringing the judge in contempt by public criticism of judges, as a failure to resort to this machinery may be a good ground for believing that the complainant did not have a genuine complaint against the judge. <br /><br />(The writer is a former solicitor general of India)<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/full_story.php?content_id=23145" target="_blank">When the judge is in the dock</a>

You assign advantages to this system when there are none, and discard its faults by making things up as you go along. All your writings in this issue have failed to convince many people of the advantages of the system, and I don't expect people to be writing to their MLA/MP asking for this to be implemented immediately. Perhaps rather than wasting your time or other peoples with an obsessive compulsive single-minded lecturing about the judges in India, maybe you should take some time off to research and mull over the problems and what the jury system means to the  US / UK in principle and practice. Then come back with fresh ideas of how they can be applicable to India. <br /><br />I've been hearing the same thing for over 2 years now - first in e-charcha, where they banned you / laughed you off their board and now here - there has been the same repititious low-level buzz on and on and on and on...

sharks,  as in really corrupt/other judges.<br /><br />India does not have the infrastructure to implement the jury system, <br /><br />jury system also has its faults. a corrupt judge can kick a trial in jury system in number of ways including by rejecting evidence that can be put before jury.<br /><br />also further appeals from jury trials are also before judges and not appellate juries.

And even in Federal Courts, different Circuits sometimes have different procedures. Same is true for judge system in India --- different states have some differences. <br /><br />There is NO proforma of Jury System in US as you seem to suggest. The ONLY common aspect in JurySys, is that "5-15 citizens are chosen AT RANDOM, and they have final power to convict/acquit". That is the ONLY main feature of Jury System. <br /><br />As per features like benefit of doubt etc, different states in US/UQ have DIFFERENT rules and procedures. And same may happen in India, different State/District may adopt different standards. Some may opt for uninanimity, some may opt for 11 out of 12, some may opt of majority verdict etc. These are MINOR issues. The main issue is that --- fixed judges form nexuses with lawyers and career criminals within six months and so they are unfair, while Jurors are less nexusprone.<br /><br />I am NOT propsing COMPLETE Procedure Code that would cover ALL issues. <br /><br />  </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">Instead you want us to adopt a hotch-potch of the new ideas which negate their advantages. </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you think thats hoch poch, thats your opinion.

In such cases, Jury System varies from state to state in US, and if details of one state are necessary condition for success, the Jury System should have failed in other states which does NOT follow those details. The reality is that all rules and procedures, irrespective of details, work or fail depending on whether judges/Jurors are nexused or not. In absence of nexus, persons are fairer and just, and so they interpret the rules fairly, or if the rules are unjust they reject it and do otherwise.<br /><br />NEXULESSNESS is the ONLY necessary and sufficient condition for justice. Random selection of 10-15 indviduals ensures a high degree of nexuslessness, and other procedures cuase minor differences.<br /><br />  </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I really don't think you have any idea of what a jury system means in principle and how the US and the UK use it. </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you have anything about judge system  or Jury System, please say that.

If and when DirectVote happens, citizens will NOT need to write to MLAs/MPs and waste their time.

RM's thesis abt Jury is all fine and accepted .. but what I find odd is why only Judges being blamed..<br /><br />I am sure most ppl havent been to court!! .....<br /><br />Has anybody seen how the lawyers fleece poor ppl who are under tremendous stress to question their OWN lawyers move ???<br /><br />When ever section of the society is involved , blaming only one is untenable...<br /><br />Wonder why RM is not so anto lawyer too ......<br /><br />Why no setting bounds for the lawyer ....

The newspapers are NOT talking about involvement of other judges except Shamit Mukherjee. Do you think other judges were involved as well? I wont be surprised. judge/land-mafia nexus is very intense in Ahemdabad, and I expect Delhi to be worse as land is far more expensive in Delhi.<br /><br />  </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> India does not have the infrastructure to implement the jury system,  </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jury System needs NO hi-fi inftastructure. One judge costs over Rs 1500/day, while 12 Jurors would cost below Rs 200/day each  i.e. Rs 2400/day. So cost may double, but nexuses reduces by an order of magnitude and integrity increases by order of magnitude.<br /><br />Brits could implement Jury System in 1400 AD and Americans could do it in 1800 AD. And Brits could use trimmed down Jury System in India from 1880s to 1947 till they left. And so did India till 1956 when DD-SCj abolished it. So if nations had infrastucture to support 12 Jurors 100s of years ago, we sure do have it today.<br /><br />  </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> jury system also has its faults. </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">such as?<br /><br />  </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">a corrupt judge can kick a trial in jury system in number of ways including by rejecting evidence that can be put before jury. </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">That is the fault of judge system,  NOT of Jury System. Thats why, in the Jury System I have proposed, there is NO judge, period. Each side alteranatively gets 1 hour to speak, where they can present ANY evidence/arguments they like. There will be 3 randomly chosen lawyers from a pool of 1000s who will advice the Jurors if such and such argument/evidence should be considered or disregarded. But they cant block any side from presenting it. IMO, the  Jurors are smart enough to decide what is relevent and what is not. And if you think commons are idiots and cant decide what arguments/evidences are relevent or irrelevent, I have no way to convince you that commons are NOT idiots, and they are as smart as the judges.<br /><br />  </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> also further appeals from jury trials are also before judges and not appellate juries. </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the system I have proposed, the appeals are also heard by Jurors and NOT by judges.

How does it contradict with any of the previous procedures I have suggested?<br /><br />Basically, there are 12 Jurors. Both sides, defense and prosecution present arguments, witnesses and evidences. And each Juror decides if the accused is guilty beyond doubt, and how malafide his intention were, and how severe was the crime, and so how much punishment accused  deserves. Each Juror gives a number. In case of civil trials, it can be financial amount, in case of criminal trial it be financial fine plus length of prison sentence. Say the punishment is to be length of prison sentence. And the 12 Jurors give prison sentences in years in INCREASING order as (a1, a2, a3, ..., a12) . The number will be 0 if the Juror thinks that prosecution hasn’t been able to prove him guilty beyond doubt.<br /><br />Now if ALL Jurors recommend SAME identical sentence. There is no dispute. But if length of sentences they recommend differ, the nation needs to make a law by which the police can decide the exact length of sentence. <br /><br />In extreme case, a state/district can make a law that "lowest of (a1 ... a12) will be taken as sentence". The state/district may also make a law that a6 be taken as a sentence. <br /><br />My suggestion is a4 <b>(1/3rd - 2/3rd demarcation line)</b> be taken as a sentence.<br /><br />So, how is this inconsistent with any of the statements I made previously?<br /><br />If I had said "lets take a3 as sentence" you could have asked SAME question. Why a3 and not a4? Such questions can be raised on EVERY issue? viz why should max sentence form theft be 3 years and 3.5 years? <br />For that matter, why does a Constitutional Amendment need 67%? Why not 75%? Why not 85%? <br /><br /><b>Such questions have ZERO significance on judges vs. Jurors debate</b>.  <br /><br />The REAL and ONLY issue in judges vs Jurors is <br /><br />1)should we call for randomly chose 12 citizen to decide imprisonment and length?<br /><br />2)should we depend on FIXED cadre of individuals (which will be less 0.01% of population) to decide the imprisonment and its length.<br /><br />The question "why should we pick 3rd or 4th or 5th lowest sentence" is irrelevant in judge vs Jurors" debate as <b>this question also shows up in judge system</b> and is resolved arbitrarily, not by any mathematical proof. Question appears when we have a bench of 3-5 or more judges. Say there are 9 judges in a bench. Say they suggest punishments as (a1, a2, a3 ... a12)= (0,0,0 , 1,1,2 , 2,3,3) years. Now what should be the length of the sentence? a3? a4? a5?<br /><br /><b>So since the objection you raised ALSO exists in judge system, it is IRRELEVENT wrt judges vs. Jurors debate.<br /></b><br /><br />[Aside : Basically, my arguments that "Jurors are superior than judges" are based on following scheme<br /><br />1)I have showed that Jurors are FAR FAR LESS NEXUS-PRONE and have less nexuses with lawyers and mafia than judges do. Examples like DDj Mukherjee further proves my point. Thus our courts will be fairer if they use Jurors instead of the judges.<br /><br />2)Given ANY flaw that is cited in Jury System, I will prove one or both of the following<br />2a)The said flaw does not exist in Jury System  OR<br />2b)The SAME flaw also exists in the judge system<br /><br />In case of (2b), the flaw cited in Jury System, even if exists, becomes IRRELEVENT wrt "the judges vs The Jurors" debate.<br /><br />Please, note --- I am NOT out to prove that The Jury System is the idealest in anyway. I have much humble goal. All I want to establish is that The Jury System is FAR FAR superior than the judge system. Or rather, judge system is far far inferior. And so we, the people of India, should expel ALL judges in lower courts, HCs as well as SC and bring the Jurors onboard.]<br /><br />-Rahul Mehta

So majority is NOT the norm as you say. And unanimity is ONLY in countries where lawyers/judges have powers to filter out Jurors at the time of selection. A true unanimity could be said to occur, when randomly chosen 12 citizens are NOT filtered out by judges/lawyers and all 12 must say guilty for conviction.  Also, in many states in US, (1 not-guilty, 11 guilty) is considered guilty. In case of civil juries, (3 not-guilty, 9 guilty) is considered guilty. So there is NO norm of unanimity as you say.  <br /><br />  </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Read and understand that I am asking for statistical proof that the 4th pick is the most fair punishment.

Why majority and not unanimous? And in case of 7 judges, why 4th  pick and NOT 2nd pick or 3rd pick? <br /><br />Pro-judge folks have NO mathematical answer to this "why xth pick out of N numbers" question. So this lack of statistical vigor is found in the design of BOTH systems, the judge system as well as The Jury System.

DDM-Outloooks reports<br /><br />"http://www.outlookindia.com/full.asp?fodname=20030512&fname=Mukherjee+%28F%29&sid=1"<br /><br />  </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Judge Dread  </b><br /><br /><b>A Delhi HC judge, land scams, wine and women. Yet another sordid saga Updates </b><br /> <br />THE OUTLOOK BUREAU <br /><br />[Phone conversation]<br /> <br /><b>Justice Shamit Mukherjee:</b> The floor fittings in the house are yet to be installed. Please get it done fast.   This time also ensure there is more Scotch and <b>the women have to be better</b>   <img border="0" title="" alt="[Big Grin]" src="biggrin.gif" />   also...<br /><br /><b>Khattar: </b>Yes, it will be done soon. Give me a few days.<br /><br />—Transcript   <br />   <br />On Fixed Lines of telephone conversation with the CBI special court That Justice Shamit Mukherjee was partial to attractive women and partying was well known in judicial circles, much before the CBI raids in April revealed his links with the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) scam kingpin, Dharambir Khattar. But the misuse-of-office charges came as a revelation, given his high-profile connections and image. For Mukherjee was part of a charmed circle—which included top lawyers, an additional solicitor general, senior editors and even top bjp leaders. <br /><br />It was to these connections that Mukherjee owed his various key appointments—first as standing counsel to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and later, as a judge of the Delhi High Court. <br /> <br />Before his elevation, he was a reasonably successful lawyer, although hardly on the ‘A’ list. Sources in the legal community say his last I-T returns before assuming judgeship ran to about Rs 16 lakh. Mukherjee was also thought to be an amiable judge. Says a senior lawyer of him: "Mukherjee created a decent impression in a high court riddled with nepotism and underhand dealings. His PR was excellent and he was on good terms with everybody." The mandatory IB report on Mukherjee at the time of his elevation also did not contain anything adverse or uncomplimentary. <br />But the picture that emerges from the CBI tap on Khattar’s six mobile phones is shockingly contradictory. Some of these phones had been given to sacked DDA chairman Subash Sharma and lands commissioner Jagdish Saran. The story the CBI pieced together was a sordid tale of sex, wine and corruption. The investigating agency had to correlate nearly 10,000 conversations and link them with files seized during the raids to make out cases that were legally admissible. CBI sources also pointed out that two more high court judges, allegedly involved in Khattar’s racket, have yet to resign. <br /><br />The transcripts, currently in the possession of CBI special court judge V.K. Jain, are a veritable Pandora’s box. In fact, some of the leads from the telephone taps are yet to be pursued by the CBI. In one such conversation (which Outlook had access to), Khattar makes a claim to a prime accused in the DDA scam that he was going out with a "chief justice" to "get things done". A reference is also made during the call to money being doled out to some bureaucrats. The code words used: murgi (chicken=Rs 1 lakh) and tota (parrot=Rs 10,000). The investigating agency is now examining if a case of disproportionate assets can be made out against Mukherjee. <br /><br />In fact, it was Mukherjee’s unseemly enthusiasm to favour businessman Vinod Khatri’s swank south Delhi restaurant, Sahara, by passing an interim order staying the widening of a road that finds him in the CBI net. Without the stay, the restaurant would have been bulldozed. According to CBI officials, it was also at his instance that DDA counsel Gita Mittal was removed from the case when she took a tough line. <br /><br />Detractors refer to Mukherjee as the ‘wheelchair judge’, a reference to his habit of bringing his paralysed wheelchair-bound wife to judicial and legal dos. It won him a great deal of sympathy and may have even helped him secure the position in the high court. Indeed, one of the points advanced in his favour by friends was that the transfer from bar to bench would give him more time with his wife. "He was socially very active. But after he became a judge, he stopped taking his wife to parties," says a high court lawyer. <br /><br />The sole point of surprise was that Mukherjee was quick to admit his guilt to the CBI. On the day of his arrest itself, Mukherjee reportedly admitted before a senior CBI official that he had committed "an act of grave indiscretion". Mukherjee also revealed that he was "very fond of women and wine", a weakness he had succumbed to after his wife’s illness. <br /><br />It was the former trait that brought Mukherjee into contact with Khattar who used to procure girls for him. His plush "guesthouses" in Asiad Village and Jangpura in south Delhi were at the disposal of his "friends", including the judge. Through his contacts in Delhi’s chatterati class, Khattar is also learnt to have provided some women from Uzbekistan to those who preferred "foreign flesh". <br /><br />Among the women Mukherjee "met" through Khattar were some B-list socialites too. Sources say he was closely involved with high court lawyer Anshu Aggarwal and it was apparently during a rocky patch in their relationship—Aggarwal had become too demanding—that Khattar became close to Mukherjee. Anshu Aggarwal, however, insists Mukherjee was nothing more than a friend. <br /><br />Aggarwal was also to prove Mukherjee’s nemesis. Four days after the CBI raided Khattar’s premises—as well as those of senior DDA officials—the crucial files linking Mukherjee to the scam came to light. The CBI referred the seized files to then Delhi High Court chief justice Devendra Gupta, who found it pertained to the cases in Mukherjee’s court. Yet, the judgements were in Aggarwal’s handwriting. The cat was out of the bag. <br /><br />Mukherjee, when asked for an explanation, reportedly claimed he was in the habit of getting his juniors to correct his judgements. As this amounted to judicial misconduct, the matter was referred to the Chief Justice of India. In the meantime, sources close to the jailed judge say a beleaguered Mukherjee tried desperately to meet law minister Arun Jaitley—who had okayed his appointment—and even spent a couple of hours outside his house. But he was unable to contact Jaitley either on phone or in person. <br /><br />The advice from all quarters was to quit and he did, apparently because he did not want the "sex scandal" part to come out. His marriage had already been under pressure because of his lifestyle. He may also have presumed that as in the case of Rajasthan High Court judge, Arun Madan, he would escape prosecution by resigning. Belatedly realising that the resignation was no protection, he tried to withdraw it. But the President of India, on the advice of the ministry of home affairs and the law minister, ruled that it would be unconstitutional. "He wanted to retract his resignation because he could claim immunity. But that did not happen," said a CBI official. <br /><br />At this point, Mukherjee seems to have lost his nerve. "He literally began babbling to colleagues over how Khattar had taken advantage of him and how he had been abandoned by his high-and-mighty friends," says a high court lawyer. He told the CBI pretty much the same thing under interrogation, until reined in by his own counsel. <br /><br />For Mukherjee, the timing of the CBI raids was unfortunate. Another couple of months and his position would have been well-nigh unassailable. His appointment would have been made permanent and nothing short of impeachment could have removed him before retirement.Indeed, a file to this effect had already been moved, but was put on hold soon after the CBI raids. <br /><br />Mukherjee’s arrest may just be the tip of the <br /><br />proverbial iceberg. The phone transcripts and Khattar’s interrogation could reveal explosive details that may even implicate senior politicians. So far, the CBI has managed to question Khattar for just half-an-hour since his arrest last month (he has been hospitalised since then). As the case unfolds, there will be many more surprises. Mukherjee has even threatened to go public with the various scams in the high court.  </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">RM had been mentioning since the begining of the time that Indian HC/SC judges are as defunct, corrupt, characterless, alcoholic, "etc" etc as Indian neta, babu, pandu etc down the street.

---<br />Please show what is INCONSISTENT about it? I.e. How does it contradict with any of the previous procedures I have suggested?<br />---<br /><br />No what it does is conflicts is with the fairness of the punishment, and if the punishment fits the crime.<br /><br />---<br />Basically, there are 12 Jurors. Both sides, defense and prosecution present arguments, witnesses and evidences. And each Juror decides if the accused is guilty beyond doubt, and how malafide his intention were, and how severe was the crime, and so how much punishment accused deserves. Each Juror gives a number. In case of civil trials, it can be financial amount, in case of criminal trial it be financial fine plus length of prison sentence. Say the punishment is to be length of prison sentence. And the 12 Jurors give prison sentences in years in INCREASING order as (a1, a2, a3, ..., a12) . The number will be 0 if the Juror thinks that prosecution hasn’t been able to prove him guilty beyond doubt.<br /><br />Now if ALL Jurors recommend SAME identical sentence. There is no dispute. But if length of sentences they recommend differ, the nation needs to make a law by which the police can decide the exact length of sentence.<br /><br />In extreme case, a state/district can make a law that "lowest of (a1 ... a12) will be taken as sentence". The state/district may also make a law that a6 be taken as a sentence.<br /><br />My suggestion is a4 (1/3rd - 2/3rd demarcation line) be taken as a sentence.<br />---<br /><br />You are avoiding answering the question. Why increasing order, why is increasing order better than decreasing order? Why is the 4th pick better than any other pick? You have presented absolutely no evidence showing it as so.<br /><br />---<br />Now if ALL Jurors recommend SAME identical sentence. There is no dispute. But if length of sentences they recommend differ, the nation needs to make a law by which the police can decide the exact length of sentence.<br />---<br /><br />Why the police? Are they less prones to "nexus-ness"? I don't get it.<br />---<br />If I had said "lets take a3 as sentence" you could have asked SAME question. Why a3 and not a4? Such questions can be raised on EVERY issue? viz why should max sentence form theft be 3 years and 3.5 years?<br />For that matter, why does a Constitutional Amendment need 67%? Why not 75%? Why not 85%?<br />---<br /><br />Yes I would have. If you have made a suggestion which you think is an improvement, then it is for you to show with evidence that this it is advantageuos. Thus far, all we have had is your opinion and lots of voodoo mathematics. You seem to be unable to present facts to support your hypothesis. As regards the Contituition amendments you will have to take it up with the framers of the constituition. Just like I am taking it up with you about your "4th pick in the series"<br /><br />---<br />Such questions have ZERO significance on judges vs. Jurors debate.<br />---<br /><br />Yes they do have significance, 'cause the Judge v Juror debate HAS to include the question of punishment and how it will be awarded. I'm sorry you don't think so, but then you have probably come with the incredible "4th pick of the series" only when inconvinient questions about hung juries, and punisment awards were raised.<br /><br />---<br />1)should we call for randomly chose 12 citizen to decide imprisonment and length?<br />---<br /><br />Why. What qualifies the randomly chosen jury to decide on the lenght of the punishment, without any basic grounding in law? Who presents the directions to the jury about what is fair and not fair? It can't be the prosecutors, because then you break another principle of the jury system - that sepration of the prosecutor from the jury. Don't tell me you expect the jury to award punishment based solely on the evidence presented by the defence and prosecution, without being guided by someone about what is within the law for them to award and what is not?<br /><br />--<br />2)should we depend on FIXED cadre of individuals (which will be less 0.01% of population) to decide the imprisonment and its length.<br />---<br /><br />Yes - till you show your system is much better.<br /><br />---<br />The question "why should we pick 3rd or 4th or 5th lowest sentence" is irrelevant in judge vs Jurors" debate as this question also shows up in judge system and is resolved arbitrarily, not by any mathematical proof. Question appears when we have a bench of 3-5 or more judges. Say there are 9 judges in a bench. Say they suggest punishments as (a1, a2, a3 ... a12)= (0,0,0 , 1,1,2 , 2,3,3) years. Now what should be the length of the sentence? a3? a4? a5?<br />---<br /><br />The lenght of the sentence would be what the MAJORITY of the judged propose. Heres a tip - its known as majority rules. And no; in the bench of judges - a majority descision is not considered arbitrary. A majority is a what most of the judges think therefore it should apply. Fair and non controversial.<br /><br />---<br />1)I have showed that Jurors are FAR FAR LESS NEXUS-PRONE and have less nexuses with lawyers and mafia than judges do. Examples like DDj Mukherjee further proves my point. Thus our courts will be fairer if they use Jurors instead of the judges.<br />---<br /><br />You have admitted in the first post on this page that it is not foolproof, and you have been unable to prove that juries CANNOT be bribed/Cajoled/threatened. All I see so far is your proposal to replace a 'borken' system with another system as liable to be broken'. <br /><br />---<br />2)Given ANY flaw that is cited in Jury System, I will prove one or both of the following<br />2a)The said flaw does not exist in Jury System OR<br />2b)The SAME flaw also exists in the judge system<br /><br />In case of (2b), the flaw cited in Jury System, even if exists, becomes IRRELEVENT wrt "the judges vs The Jurors" debate.<br />---<br /><br />Call me slow, but I need to ask re 2b, so why replace a flawed system with another one which has the same flaw? And it is not irelavant, because it can be challenged Constituitionally.<br /><br />---<br />... All I want to establish is that The Jury System is FAR FAR superior than the judge system. Or rather, judge system is far far inferior. ..<br />---<br /><br />You are not doing a good job of it. Thousands of words and a only few converts only show you are probably not sending the right message.<br /><br />---<br />There is NO country which uses majority in the Jury System. So majority is NOT the norm as you say. And unanimity is ONLY in countries where lawyers/judges have powers to filter out Jurors at the time of selection. A true unanimity could be said to occur, when randomly chosen 12 citizens are NOT filtered out by judges/lawyers and all 12 must say guilty for conviction. Also, in many states in US, (1 not-guilty, 11 guilty) is considered guilty. In case of civil juries, (3 not-guilty, 9 guilty) is considered guilty. So there is NO norm of unanimity as you say.<br />---<br /><br />Ok on the one hand you state that no country uses a majority system, and then in the same para you state unanimity is only where judges lawyers have the power to filter the jury. I don't understand - what happens if the jury is not filtered and there is no majority? Which is what I think you propose for India.<br /><br />Consider this as question 1a<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Q1 - Why is the 4th pick in the series statiscally fair to the accused when awarding punishment?<br /><br />Q1a- Why is a majority descision not fair and the 4th pick better when there is no filtration of the jury by lawyers?

Most important question first<br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Rahul</b>: should we depend on FIXED cadre of individuals (which will be less 0.01% of population) to decide the imprisonment and its length.<br /><br /><b>Shalav</b>: Yes - till you show your system is much better.</font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">Show to whom?<br /><br />Can you specify, whom , i.e. which individuals I need to convince that The Jurors are better than the judges?<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Rahul</b>: If I had said "lets take a3 as sentence" you could have asked SAME question. Why a3 and not a4? Such questions can be raised on EVERY issue. viz why should max sentence form theft be 3 years and not 3.5 years? For that matter, why does a Constitutional Amendment need 67%? Why not 75%? Why not 85%?<br /><br /><b>Shavalv</b>: Yes I would have.  </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">There you go. so why don’t you ask these questions to judges like why should retirement age be 65 years and not 66 or 70 years? Or recently when punishment for check bounce was raised from 1 year to 2 years, why not raise the SAME question --- why 2 years and not 1.5 or 3 years? Putting it other way, lack of mathematical rigor is there in ALL proposals of law, and so it cant be cited as unique flaw in my proposal. Because any alternative proposal you take, including "keep status-quo proposal", you  will ALSO have this flaw.<br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Thus far, all we have had is your opinion and lots of voodoo mathematics. You seem to be unable to present facts to support your hypothesis. </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have ONLY one hypothesis as far as THIS thread goes, and when SAME individuals (i.e. judges) sit in the SAME court for 4-5 years and similar courts for 20-25 years, they become nexused with lawyers/mafia. That can be shown even WITHOUT mathematics as well, by empirical evidences like news-reports we get about judges like Shamit. The mathematics helps in guessing the extent to which judges are nexused to someone who has less exposure to courts. To those who have attended courts frequently, they don’t even need this Maths. Without argument, they accept that Indian judges are as nexused as Indian pandu/neta.<br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Rahul</b>: Such questions (why 4th pick and not xth) have ZERO significance on judges vs. Jurors debate.<br /><br /><b>Shaval</b>: Yes they do have significance, 'cause the Judge v Juror debate HAS to include the question of punishment and how it will be awarded. </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">The question ALSO comes up in judge system when there is a bench of 2 or more judges. Say in a bench of 7 judges. When 7 judges differ about length of punishment, "xth one out of 7 is picked". No one has given any mathematical reasoning to show that why xth is better than any other pick.<br /><br />So this question, "why pick xth" is in BOTH systems and remains unanswered.<br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Shalav</b> : What qualifies the randomly chosen jury to decide on the length of the punishment, without any basic grounding in law?  </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thanks for asking a relevant question. Now I have answered this question at least 10 times in this thread and I have answered this to YOU at least TWICE. Nevertheless, I will answer this question again.<br /><br />The procedure of randomly selecting 12 citizens [Jurors] from a population of millions is SUPERIEOR than using a fixed cadre of individuals (judges) as within a few months, these fixed individuals cultivate nexuses with lawyers/mafia (mafia = career criminals) who meet these judges almost on daily/weekly basis. <br /><br />In justice, nexus-less-ness is far far more importance than knowledge of law. Eg. judge Shamit had nexus with mafia Khattar. Say Khattar beats up someone and case goes to judge Shamit. Shamit would just throw date after date after date and thus tire the witness/complainer to run flee. This is exactly what is happening in over 95% of India's 13000 courts. Each judge sitting there is as nexused as pandu, neta or a babu down the street. And you know how nexused our neta are, and judges are equally nexused with criminals/lawyers.<br /><br />So random selection, (and avoiding repetitions) ensures more nexuslessness, and so Jurors are better than judges. <br /><br />Also while judges may have better idea of what is written in law-books, they have ZERO knowledge about ground reality. This NOT a fact invented by RM, but a fact also accepted by Supreme Court judges of US as well as esteemed statesmen like Thomasbhai Jeffersonjee and Madisonjee. <br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Who presents the directions to the jury about what is fair and not fair? </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once again, I have ANSWERED this question to you before. <br /><br />what is fair/unfair is decided by Jurors. The Jurors may need some guidance about details of the current law. Both lawyers will argue what is written in the law-text and what it would mean. In addition, in my proposal, 3 lawyers are chosen at random from a pool of 100s of lawyers practicing in that district, and these 3 lawyers will be called to preside over that trial. The Jurors can ask guidance about law from these 3 lawyers. <br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Shalav</b>: The length of the sentence would be what the MAJORITY of the judged propose.

Also, it gives MINIMAL benefit of doubt, and you are assuming that each decision was honest. So there is NOTHING to show that majority-verdict is always better than a super-majority verdict, if one wants to admit the possibility of bribe and want more benefit of doubt.<br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Rahul</b>: I have showed that Jurors are <b>FAR FAR LESS NEXUS-PRONE</b> and have less nexuses with lawyers and mafia than judges do.

One less flaw.<br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Rahul</b>: All I want to establish is that The Jury System is FAR FAR superior than the judge system. ...<br /><b>Shalav</b>: You are not doing a good job of it. </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not happy?

I don't understand - what happens if the jury is not filtered and there is no majority? Which is what I think you propose for India. </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">[I would like to correct what I said  --- that "no country uses majority verdict in Jury System". It is "no country, other than Scotland, uses majority verdict in Jury System ..."]<br /><br />Filtering is done BEFORE the trial starts. It only REDUCES the possibility of hung-Jury. Despite filtering there may be hung-Juries.<br />So even country which use filtering are faced with hung-Jury and have laws to obtain the verdict in case of hung Juries.<br /><br />[The way filtering reduces the chances of hung-Jury is as follows<br /><br />Say 12 people are chosen at random. Say 3 are likely to say not-guilty, and 9 are likely to say guilty.<br /><br />Now instead of 12, say 60 people are chosen. Then 45 are likely to say guilty and 15 are likely to say not-guilty. The prosecution will try to exclude not-guilty-sayers while defense will try to exclude those who may say guilty. Not that they will always succeed in guessing the person correctly, but they will succeed with some probability. So each party can exclude 24 individuals so that (60 - 24*2) = 60 - 48 = 12 are left. The prosecution may be able to exclude all 15 who are likely to say not-guilty, in which case verdict may be unanimous.<br /><br />Basically, the possibility of unanimity INCREASES due to exclusion/filtering.]<br /><br />The Jury Systems, when it comes to size and condition for conviction are arbitrary and vary from nation to nation, state to state<br /><br />The size of Jury also changes. My suggestion is to use 12 Jurors for ALL cases, except when there is no prison sentence and fine is less than Rs 10,000/- in which case 5 Jurors can be used. (Why 12? Why not 10, 11, or 15? Why Rs 10,000/- why not Rs 10,001? And why 6, why not 5? Please dont waste your time bothering me with such question)<br /><br />Scotland uses 15 Jurors. NZ uses 12 Jurors, but for petty crimes with low punishment, it may be as low as 6. US mostly uses 12 Jurors but smaller Juries are used for petty crimes and pure civil offenses. And NO ONE has any mathematical reason why size should N and NOT (N+1).<br /><br />For conviction/acquittal conditions also vary.<br /><br />1)Scotland has NO filtering/exclusions and has 15 member Jury. It requires majority for acquittal/conviction. The judge decides the length of sentence and there is NO rule, but length of sentence does end up depending on whether verdict was unanimous or simple-majority. But since there is no hung Jury, there is seldom a re-trial. Scotland is perhaps the only country which uses majority for conviction/acquittal, otherwise most countries require unanimous or at least a super-majority for BOTH conviction and acquittal.<br /><br />2)UK has 12 Jurors. (0/1/2 not-guilty, 12/11/10 guilty) is guilty. (10/11/12 not-guilty, 2/1/0 guilty) is not-guilty. Anything else means re-trial. If there hung Jury even in re-trial, it would result into acquittal. <br /><br />3)In US, some states need unanimous verdict. Some states need (0/1 not-guilty, 12/11 guilty) for guilty and (11/12 not-guilty, 1/0 guilty) for not-guilty. Anything else is hung Jury followed by a re-trial. Many times, prosecutions drop the case after hung-Jury and thus acquittal would follow. Two hung Juries would result into acquittal.<br /><br />So different countries/states, different ARBITRARY rules. None have mathematical proofs to justify their rules as you have asked for.<br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Why is a majority decision not fair and the 4th pick better when there is no filtration of the jury by lawyers? </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">Majority scheme is based on minimal BoD ("benefit of doubt"). A super-majority scheme is based on some higher level of BoD. A unanimous verdict for conviction is to provide MAXIMAL BoD.<br /><br />Unanimity assumes a very low level of possibility of threat/bribery. "4th pick" reduces the possibility of verdict by threat/bribery, as threatening/bribing 4 Jurors is several times more difficult than threatening/bribing 1 Juror. And 4th pick has MORE BoD than 6th pick i.e. majority.<br /><br />No country has mathematical reasoning to support the sizes of their Jury and Grand Jury they use. Nor do they have mathematical proofs to justify the conditions for acquittal/conviction or hung-Jury/re-trials.<br /><br />Now if you have anything for/against the BASIC principle forwarded in this thread that "instead of fixed judges, 12 randomly chosen citizens should be used to decide punishments/acquittals" you are welcome.<br /><br />For your "why 20 and not 19" type queries, please start some other thread.<br /><br />-Rahul Mehta

We give him nearly final power to resolve 100 important cases and 100-200 minor cases to that ONE PERSON every YEAR, and allow him to sit the same region for 3-4 years. On top of that, we grant him 100% immunities of all kinds. Isnt is EXPECTED that he would start seeking monetary and "other" favors from mafia?<br /><br />IMO, it is NOT time to beat forehead or even get anguished. Its time we beat and curse these neta/intellectuals who have created such an idotic system of fixed judges. IMO, we dont even need to beat them, cursing them will suffice for time being. And along with cursing them we should work to replace this system of fixed judges with The Jury System. How? Two small steps <br /><br />1)Force MPs/MLAs to pass bill that would allow commons to register their YES/NO DIRECTLY in Assembly/Parliament<br /><br />2)Using (1) pass acts to expell ALL judgesand replace them by Jurors.<br /><br />Beating foreheads will be waste of time. And you will benefitting these Nbjs. In fact, that's all they want that we keep beating our own and each other's heads and meanwhile they can get air-consitioners, flooring and [censored]-services from mafia.<br /><br />   </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">Originally posted by John Umrao:<br />But on positive note look at the <b>'Judge'</b> passing strictures on the (in) equality of service rendered.

Rahul:<br /><br />You said (I paraphrase) "To avoid hung juries we should take take the 4th pick in series"<br /><br />The question is very simple. I am not asking you to provide examples of your opinion of what happens in other instances. All I'm asking you to do is to show that your proposal is fair to the accused. You are trying to divert attention from being unable to show this mathematically.  <br /><br />I think you are unable to answer even this simple question about your proposal. How do you expect to sell it to others who have more vested interests in this?<br /><br />The question still stands<br /><br />Q1 - Please show that statiscally your proposal for the 4th pick is better than any other pick or a majority/unanimous verdict. <br /><br />PS: You have to show that it stands the test of fairness by itself not as compared to other systems - only because your proposal envisages the discard of other systems.<br /><br />Please stick to the question. Your other points will be addressed once you can show proof that the 4th pick is the best pick.<br /><br />PPS: Now you want me to start another thread when you are unable to support your hypothesis. What happened to I will prove anything you ask me to - just don't get personal?<br /><br />BTW this 4th pick is central to the deconstruction of your proposal. Therefore if you can't answer why the 4th pick is the best pick, please admit it and I will move on to the next question?

</font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Sriram Kaushik </b> : [in a different thread]<br />I have admired some of the little things in the US:<br /><br />1) Buses stopping at the railroad crossings.<br />..<br />4) School buses having standard, prominent color.<br /><br />I have thought a lot more but I've mentioned that came to my immediate mind. I'm sure there are rules, laws and codes already in place but <b>I wish they get implemented or introduced in a phased manner in India.</b></font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">This thread is dedicated to curse corrupt judges   <img border="0" title="" alt="[Big Grin]" src="biggrin.gif" />   , discuss The Jury System, and also to show that ALL differences between India and US are due to differences in speed/fairness between Indian courts and US-courts.<br /><br />Allow me to explain, how questions like "buses in US stop and railroads and Indian buses often don’t" and "why US-truck-drivers drive more carefully than Indian truck-drivers" are related to differences in courts’ speed/fairness.<br /><br />The US-courts (= US-Jurors) would PUNISH the bus-driver as well as bus-owning company for such violations like not stopping at a railroad. Whereas Indian-courts (= Indian-judges) are too busy and so they don’t find time for such petty matters.<br /><br />Now another reason is that US-insurance-companies in US also take such offenses (of crossing the rail roads without stopping) seriously even when they DO NOT result into accident. Why do US-insurance-companies take it seriously, while Indian-insurance-companies ignore it? Because in case accident actually happens, US-courts (=US-Jurors) force insurance-companies and bus-owning-companies to cough up a HUGE compensation on an ASAP-basis. Where Indian-courts (=Indian-judges) take years and years to deliver a compensation that is sub-peanuts even by Indian standard (eg SC-CjI Pathak Carbidewala).<br /><br />So US-courts (=US-Jurors) punish US-insurance-companies, US-bus-owners, US-bus-drivers when things go wrong, partially or wholly. Whereas Indian-courts stay idle.<br /><br />So US-bus-owners, scared of US-courts, force US-bus-drivers to go by the book. And US-insurance-companies, due to fear of courts and NO OTHER REASON, take some steps to force US bus-companies to further take more steps.<br /><br />Somewhat aside : many bus/truck-owners put "call 1-800-ABCDEFG" to report complaints in case truck driver’s driving is rash. Did you notice EVEN ONE, EVEN ONE, such truck in India? No. Why are Us-truck-owners so vigilant? Because they know that US-courts (=US-Jurors) will literally burn their b1lls if truck driver messes up due to rash driving. So they want to kick out such rash drivers no matter how productive they are, at any cost, and so they seek outsiders’ co-operation. Whereas Indian truck owners know that if truck blows away someone, judges like "bring more scotch and [censored] should be better" will preside, and so there is not much reason to worry.<br /><br />So Sriram Kaushik and all, unless our courts starts PUNISHING people who show such willful negligence, such negligence etc would continue irrespective of how many NGOs preach for how many hours. You can bore the bus/truck-owners or bus/driver to death with bhaashan after bhaashan after bhaashan, but AFAIT, laato ke bhoot baato se nahi maante. Severe financial fines and prisons (in extreme cases) are MUST to change the hearts of these bus/truck owners. So fast/fair court is MINIMALLY necessary and over-sufficient to get ALL the four changes you wished, and many more that will appear in that thread.<br /><br />  </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Please add to this list where ever you came across and hope they are taken care of/considered. </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">Create a court-sector that can dispose a complain, this way or that way, within sat 2-6 months, FAIRLY.<br /><br />-Rahul Mehta

Shalav,<br /><br />I had asked you a question, which IMO is the MOST important question that comes out from your posts, and I will re-ask it here<br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Rahul:</b> should we depend on FIXED cadre of individuals (which will be less 0.01% of population) to decide the imprisonment and its length.<br /><br /><b>Shalav: </b> Yes - till you show your system is much better.<br /></font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">My question was : Show to whom?

That citizens should FOCUS ONLY on the DirectVote proposal so that they can get a procedure to register YES/NO DIRECTLY in Assembly/Parliament. And then they can pass Jury laws WITHOUT even asking/knowing neta, judges, mafia and lawyers what they think about The Jury System. <br /><br />No one needs to worry about what the judges etc think about The Jury System.<br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> You have to show that it stands the test of fairness by itself not as compared to other systems - only because your proposal envisages the discard of other systems. </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">Absolutely wrong.<br /><br />In law and administration, it is sufficient to show that a proposal is "better" than<br />1)existing proposal<br />2)better than other alternatives proposed<br /><br />The person NEED NOT show that his proposal is BEST amongst the set of INFINITE possible permutations. <br /><br />Existing procedure : Use 1,2,3, 4, 5 or more FIXED judges to decide acquittal/punishment, use [N/2]th pick in case of disagreement in case there are more than 1 judges.<br /><br />My proposal : Use 12 randomly chosen citizens to decide acquittal/punishment, and take 4th pick in case of disagreement<br />My proposal is BETTER than a large fraction of existing 13000 Indian judges have nexuses with mafia and lawyers. While Jurors in most cases will be nexusless. So my proposal is better as it is LESS NEXUS-PRONE. <br /><br />I don’t need to prove that proposal is better than EACH of the millions of possible permutations  (like "use 15 Jurors, use 5th pick", "use 12 Jurors use 3rd pick" etc)<br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The question still stands --- Please show that statiscally your proposal for the 4th pick is better than any other pick or a majority/unanimous verdict. </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I told you once before : if ALL you have to ask is "why 20th and NOT 19th" type question, please start another thread.

You may or may not move to next question, but if that question is "why select 12 Jurors and not select 15 Jurors" or  "show mathematically why selecting 12 Jurors is FAIREST way" etc, please start another thread. <br /><br />I will repeat, the KEY reason why people in various countries switched to the Jury System and why I also insist we should fire the judges and use Jury System is following --- a Jury consisting 12 citizens chosen at random from lakhs will be far less nexused with mafia/lawyers/babu/neta than a bench of 1-2-more individuals chosen from a fixed tiny cadre. <br /><br />I will further state --- there is NO OTHER REASON which makes Jury System superior. So there is really no point in talking about OTHER points of Jury System like "why xth pick" or "why have N jurors". <br /><br />-Rahul Mehta

Its been a lo...ng debate doggedly and simultaneuosly carried out both in-context and out-of-context in many threads in the HICAF  forum... judge vs jury system. <br /><br />Okay  <img border="0" title="" alt="[Roll Eyes]" src="rolleyes.gif" />   RM,  accepted that judge system develops and nurtures nexus. Can that problem be tackled in any manner rather than changing the system itself, lock stock and barrel? Have you thought about that? Say, (i)a judge could be mandatorily transferred in a time bound manner from court to court, so that he is not able to develop the 'nexus',(ii) Scrap the power enjoyed by the judge to hold any criticism at ransom by labelling all such action as 'contempt of court', (iii) make a law that a judge MUST decide a case in a time bound manner. You could add or take a few.  <br /><br />As for jury system, apart from everything else, how do you propose that the jury get selected? Would it be a 'fundamental duty' of every citizen to serve on the jury?The jury would be selected from electoral rolls? From telephone directory? Or only from list of people  who volunteer to serve on the jury? <br /><br />Every process of selection of the jury would still have a subjective bias, however randomly they may be  selected. As for nexus, well if anybody were that desperate to have a decision in his  favour,and he had the means, he could bribe his way through the jury as well... So there!!!

Rahul;<br /><br />---<br />My question was : Show to whom? Can you specify, whom , i.e. which individuals do I need to convince that The Jurors are better than the judges?<br />---<br /><br />-You've answered your own question with...<br /><br />---<br />And when did I say that I plan to sell this proposal to those who have vested interest in the judge-system such as judges and those with whom they have nexuses like mafia, lawyers etc ?<br /><br />On the contrary, I have explicitly said OTHER WAY round. That citizens should FOCUS ONLY on the DirectVote proposal so that they can get a procedure to register YES/NO DIRECTLY in Assembly/Parliament. And then <b>they can pass Jury laws WITHOUT even asking/knowing neta</b>, judges, mafia and lawyers what they think about The Jury System.<br />---<br /><br />---<br />Absolutely wrong.<br /><br />In law and administration, it is sufficient to show that a proposal is "better" than<br />1)existing proposal<br />2)better than other alternatives proposed<br /><br />The person NEED NOT show that his proposal is BEST amongst the set of INFINITE possible permutations.<br />---<br /><br />-Quick observation. In this case you have niether been able to show that your proposal is better than the existing system, NOR have you shown that it is better than the alternatives. When I asked you to show why the 4th pick is better than the alternative of any other pick/unanimous/majority descision, you cannot do so. <br /><br />On the one hand you accept that the alternative proposal has to be better than the present system  AND other alternatives proposed and on the other you say...<br /><br />---<br />I don’t need to prove that proposal is better than EACH of the millions of possible permutations (like "use 15 Jurors, use 5th pick", "use 12 Jurors use 3rd pick" etc)<br />---<br /><br />-Did you even see the contradiction when you posted this? I am not asking you to prove it the best amongst millions of permutations. You only have to prove it the best amongst 13 other alternatives (any one of the 1st pick through the 12th pick or a unanimous or a majority descision). Neither have I questioned your assumption of 12 jurors. How hard can that be if you've done your home work?<br /> <br />---<br />And I told you once before : if ALL you have to ask is "why 20th and NOT 19th" type question, please start another thread. Please don’t waste this thread with why "12 Jurors and NOT 13 or 15 Jurors, and why 4th pick and not 3rd or 5th pick" type questions.<br />---<br /><br />-Oh! Any proposal has to show it is better than the alternatives, as admitted by you just a few paragraphs earlier. Why are you dodging the issue?<br /><br />---<br />I have never said I will prove anything you ask me to. I only said that I will refund the money you have paid if you are not happy with my answers. And I will answer the question if *I* think they are RELEVANT, and if not, I will cite my reasons why the questions are IRRELEVANT with the proposal.<br />---<br /><br />-Not really. You accepted that you would answer questions when you wrote<br /><br />---<br />And as usual, you have run out of arguments against counter-arguments I gave in favor of Jury System (that the Jurors are less nexusprone compared to judges, and so the courts will be fairer) and you have resorted to "advicing" me about what I should do in my life. A subtle way of making a personal attack, but I am too thick skinned, and will not make the mistake of retaliating. Sorry if that displeases you.<br /><br />Once again, <b>if you have anything for/against judge system or Jury System, you are welcome to write</b>. Please dont spoil this thread by "what I should do next in life" etc suggestions.<br />---<br /><br />-I have some doubt about the 4th pick - don't think it is fair. Apparently you will answer only questions which you think are relevant - also it is apparent that questions you cannot answer become irelevant to you! How convinient.<br /><br /> <br />---<br />The question "why take 4th pick and NOT take nth pick" is IRRELEVANT. You may or may not move to next question, but if that question is "why select 12 Jurors and not select 15 Jurors" or "show mathematically why selecting 12 Jurors is FAIREST way" etc, please start another thread.<br />---<br /><br />-It is not irelevant simply because you think so. Earlier in your reply you said you want the citizens to vote for this system. As a citizen I have relavant question which you are unable to answer. I don't think anyone else is too convinced about this 4th pick business either.<br /><br />---<br />I will repeat, the KEY reason why people in various countries switched to the Jury System and why I also insist we should fire the judges and use Jury System is following --- a Jury consisting 12 citizens chosen at random from lakhs will be far less nexused with mafia/lawyers/babu/neta than a bench of 1-2-more individuals chosen from a fixed tiny cadre.<br />---<br /><br />-The key is that there are judges who guide the jury in those countries which have opted for the jury system. THERE IS NO COUNTRY WHICH PRACTICES THE JURY SYSTEM WHITHOUT JUDGES - WHICH IS WHAT YOU WANT US TO DO. <br /><br />-<b>Heres question #2</b> - Why NOT have judges to guide the jury? All the examples of the jury system that you have presented have judges - Why does your proposal discard judges altogether - what will make your system better than the system already in practice in your example countries? What will prevent miscarraige of justice - without judges to preside over the trial.<br /><br />---<br />I will further state --- there is NO OTHER REASON which makes Jury System superior. So there is really no point in talking about OTHER points of Jury System like "why xth pick" or "why have N jurors".<br />---<br /><br />-Since you cant prove the 4th pick is fair to the accused, we will move on and consider this proposal of the 4th pick as not right for us. BTW I have not even asked why have 12 jurors. Dont obsfucate the issue. We will take it one at a time. If I have to ask you why 12 jurors I will get to it presently. For now I have a new question for you, after you failed to answer the 1st one.<br /><br />TO summarize<br /><br />Q1 - Why 4th pick? - We got no answer why the 4th pick is the best pick. Therefore since it cannot be proved as the best pick we will consider it as discredited.<br /><br />Q2 - Why no judges to preside over jury trials?

Holiday Inn Inc is Babu.<br />Nation <br /> <br />  <br />201 holidays of 365 days for Govt servants make MPs see red<br /><br />Press Trust of India<br /><br />New Delhi, May 7: Innumerable holidays outnumbering working days in government perturbed the elders who demanded limiting the number of national holidays to just three. <br /><br />The issue was raised in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday through a special mention by Congress members Saifuddin Soz and Rajeev Shukla which was widely supported by several members including Shipping minister Shatrughan Sinha. <br /><br /><b>Government employees enjoyed as many as 201 holidays out of 365 days in a year outnumbering the working days which came to just 164, Soz said adding nowhere in the world so many holidays were given to government employees. </b><br /><br />While the government was quick in implementing the Fifth Pay Commission's report, it ignored the recommendation on curtailing holidays. <br /><br />The Fifth Pay Commission apart from recommending revival of six-day week had suggested only three national holidays &#8212; Republic Day, Independence Day and Mahatma Gandhi birthday, Soz said. <br /><br />"India must take a lesson from the strongest of monarchies in the world, Saudi Arabia, where two and a half hour holiday is allowed on the demise of the monarch," Soz said. <br /><br />In a lighter vein, CPI(M) Member A Vijayaraghavan told the cricket administrator Shukla that cricket was the big problem in the country which contributed greatly to loss of mandays in government. <br /><br />Deputy Chairperson Najma Heptulla said frequent absence of members in the House should also be looked into. <br /> <br /><br />( The only GOI workers who never like holiday concept are the one who can make money when they are at their jobs)

And if you are NOT happy with the answers, I will refund the money you have paid.<br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The key is that there are judges who guide the jury in those countries which have opted for the jury system. <br /><br />THERE IS NO COUNTRY WHICH PRACTICES THE JURY SYSTEM WHITHOUT JUDGES - WHICH IS WHAT YOU WANT US TO DO. <br /><br />-<b>Here is question #2</b> - Why NOT have judges to guide the jury? All the examples of the jury system that you have presented have judges - Why does your proposal discard judges altogether - what will make your system better than the system already in practice in your example countries? </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I explained that OTHER countries are using ARBITRARY measures to resolve hung Juries, and NO country has mathematical statistical proofs for this strategy, your response was " forget other countries, explain why THIS proposal uses 4th pick". Now when I said "no judges", you say "OTHER COUNTRIES use judges, why don’t you use judges".<br /><br />Make up your mind --- is "Other Countries" argument is valid or NOT?<br /><br />[As far as I go, my argument is NOT "other countries". The citizens of INDIA will decide by registering YES/NO.]<br /><br /><b>Now coming to you question :- why NOT use judges AT ALL.</b><br /><br />First, lets clarify what I mean by word "judge". A judge is an APPOINTED individual, who is permanent staff of govt. <br /><br />In the proposal I suggested --- say there is a case in a district with say 20,00,000 citizens , typical size of an Indian district. Such a district will have say some 1000-2000 lawyers, with more than certain years/case of experience. Then 3 are chosen at RANDOM and will HAVE TO serve as guide to the Jurors. <br /><br />So like west, the Jurors in my proposal DO HAVE someone to guide them. <br /><br />But unlike West, these individuals are NOT permanent, they are NOT employees of state, they DO NOT have a career, there is no such thing a promotion, and after the case, they become ordinary lawyer as they were before.<br /><br />So Jurors do have a guide. But he is NOT permanent employee of the State, and thus not a judge in the conventional sense.<br /><br />Now when you make statement "all examples you gave [of other countries], have judges ...' it is important to note that judges in those countries  are NOT same as judges in India. eg judges in many districts/states in US are ELECTED, not appointed. Even when they are appointed, they are appointed by Prez/Gov and appointment needs at least approval of majority of Legislature. So yes, American courts have judges, but the process of their selection is FAR FAR more democratic than procedures use to appoint Indian judges, where judges appoint judges.<br /><br />Basically, due to procedures like election of judges, the judges in US are less nexused than judges in India, who do NOT need any approval of citizens.<br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">What will prevent miscarriage of justice - without judges to preside over the trial. </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do you have any statistical proof that chances of miscarriage decrease due to presence of judges? I am NOT asking for proof as such, I am ONLY showing IRREVALNCE of you demand of asking for ‘STATISTICAL PROOF’.<br /><br />There is NO evidence to support that presence of judge will improve fairness in the court. <b>On the contrary, due to nexuses he has with lawyers/mafia, the fairness will DECREASE.</b> So chances of miscarriage REDUCE by removing the judge and replacing him by 3 individuals who are well trained in law, but less prone to nexus.<br /><br />Besides, as more and mroe news reports come about bribery of judges, it is clear that judges are NOT trustworty of the job of even guiding the Jurors. So we have no option but to fire them anyway. There are NO good judges left in India and so no good proposal can be constructed using them. <br /><br />Therefore my proposal is void of judges.<br /><br />Summary<br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Q2 - Why no judges to preside over jury trials? </font><hr /></blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Jurors need someone to guide them. The lawyers of opposite sides are two guides. In addition there are 3 lawyers chosen at random. There are NO fixed PERMANENT individuals who will serve as guide as individuals in such permanent positions are very likely to get nexused with lawyers and mafia.<br /><br />And I will repost my question<br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><hr /><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Shalav</b>: ... till you show your [propoed Jury] system is much better.<br /><br /><b>Rahul</b> :Show to whom?

I just would like to know YOUR answer to the question that comes out DIRECTLY from your statement. How do you think needs to convinced for this proposal (or any proposal that seeks change in law)?<br /><br />-Rahul Mehta

Rahul:<br /><br />Methinks you are have not shown anyhing of the sort when you say juries have are less nexus prone. Arbitrary numbers of judges and juries from your imagination is not proof. <br /><br />I'm sorry but I used to think that you were sincere. I now understand that you are making all these proposals without any scientific backing at all. Numbers that you think are right have to be supported by you. No one else has to show anything to you. After all you are the one making the points, I am only asking you to prove them - which after all these posts are not forthcoming.<br /><br />I stand by my statement - You should go back and rethink your proposal. <br /><br />BTW why should I quote anyone else when you answer your question yourself? You are a funny guy - bogging down in the details of who said waht instead of answering genuine queries. <br /><br />You proposal of 4th pick does not stand to scientific scrutiny - simply because you can't support it with evidence to show it is the best option - not between millions of options but against only 13 other options. I'll give you the chance to answert his question again - can you show your proposal for the 4th pick is the best option amongst the 14 otions? <br /><br />As regards your answer to the why no judges to preside over jury trials. All you've presented is inuendo and hearsay. And in support of your proposal all you've presented is a "statement of desire" - You hope that the prosecutor and the defence layer will be able to guide the jury on the points of law - Is there any proof that they can? What prevents the "guide to the jurors" forming a 'nexus' with criminal elements? If as you say all judges have been corrupted and are a part of a nexus, what prevents the 'guide to the jurors' from also becoming part of that nexus. <br /><br />In an earlier post in this page you also made a proposal that the police settle or decide case of hung jury or something like that. If you weren't so self righteous I would have let it go - but now I have to ask you - what happens to the principle of sepration of the accuser from the punisher - which is also a basis of the justice system if you want it to be fair - Further what makes you think the police are less nexus prone than the judges.<br /><br />IMVHO you've taken a good idea - twisted it to suit your convuluted thinking, and are getting more and more confused as relevant questions are asked. Unfortunately for your case which you are making here - you seem to have lost sight of what you originally proposed - most of which was understandable, and are wandering here and there making more and more proposterous suggestions as you go along.<br /><br />Before I go - I reccomend you read William Forsyth's book "History of Trial by Jury". It is a  good summary of why the jury system was implemented and the thoughts and principles behind it - in the past as well as the present. You have taken a good idea - added your own masala and ruined it. Here it is not a case of too many cooks... but too much masala spoiling the broth.<br /><br />Furthermore if it is not your intention to convince people - why keep posting here and waste bandwidht? You haven't convinced me about your ideas, and when i ask you questions so that I can be convinced, you dismiss my questions as irelevant! How droll!
