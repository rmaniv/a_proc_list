I think we can conduct 200,000 jury trials at one time with our present 20,000 judges. We don't need to recruit a single new judge for conducting 200,000 jury trials at a time.

1. Basically, the judge will **not** sit beside the jury while the trial is being conducted. 

2. The plaintiff's and defendant's counsel (lawyers) will document (a) all evidence and (b) all the questions they wish to ask any witness before the trial starts to the judge. 

3. The judge will give evidence and the list of questions to the opposing counsel once he received them. The opposing counsel can then send a list of all objections they have against certain evidence or questions. 

4. The judge will then decide whether an evidence is admissible or not a particular evidence is admissible or whether he wants to sustain or overrule an objection. The judge will document all admissible evidence and the lists of all questions to which there were no objections or they were overruled and provide that document to both counsels and the "case coordinator" (let's call this "the case file" for now).

5. If any counsel presents in front of the jury an evidence deemed in admissible by the judge or a question to which the objection has been sustained, the opposing counsel can raise an objection. 

6. The case coordinator will then verify from the case file and tell the jury whether the arguing counsel presenting an inadmissible evidence or a question against which the objection was sustained. If either counsel disagrees with the case coordinator, they can show their case files to the jury. The jury's decision on whether they want to see the evidence or hear the witness' answer to the question will be final.
