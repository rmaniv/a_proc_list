# BRF Topic: Corruption/nexuses of Indian judges

In 2002 AD, a thread was started on [Bharat Rakshak Forum](https://forums.bharat-rakshak.com/) to discuss corruption/nexuses of Indian judges and Jury system as an alternative; but, it was deleted as it crossed the 10 pages i.e. 400 posts limit. Those pages (9 in total, idk how) were saved by Mr. Rahul Mehta, the person who started this thread. I got these pages from him and uploaded them on my website. I'm putting the links here for all who want to read it.
