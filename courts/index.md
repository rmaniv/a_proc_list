# BRF Topic: Corruption/nexuses of Indian judges

A thread to discuss corruption/nexuses of Indian judges and Jury system as an alternative was once started on [Bharat Rakshak Forum](https://forums.bharat-rakshak.com/); but, it was deleted as it crossed 10 pages i.e. 400 posts. Those pages were saved by Mr. Rahul Mehta, the person who started this thread, and I got these pages from him. I have uploaded these pages on my website for all concerned citizens of Bharat who wish to read it.
