## BRF Topic: Corruption/nexuses of Indian judges

In 2002 AD, a thread was started on [Bharat Rakshak Forum](https://forums.bharat-rakshak.com/) to discuss corruption/nexuses of Indian judges and Jury system as an alternative; but, it was deleted as it crossed the page limit. Those pages were saved by Mr. Rahul Mehta, the person who started this thread. I got these pages from him and uploaded them on my website. I'm putting the links here for all who want to read it.
