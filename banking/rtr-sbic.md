# Proposed Right to Recall SBI Chairman

## Statement of Purpose

The State Bank of India (SBI) and several other banks have the power to increase the supply of broad money (M3). To keep inflation in check, the people of India need to keep the supply of broad money in check and hence, the chairman of the SBI should be accountable to the people of India. This proposed law, if published in the Gazette of India after being approved by the Cabinet, will allow voters of India to replace the existing chairman of the SBI with a new one as and when they like; thus, making the chairman accountable to the citizens. This will also improve the services of SBI and reduce corruption.
