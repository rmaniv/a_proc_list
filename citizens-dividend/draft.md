## Part - I: General Instructions for All Citizens

(01) Every voter will receive a DhanVapsi Passbook within 30 days of the publication of this statute in the gazette.

(02) After this law is published in the gazette, 65% of the amount received from the mineral royalties, spectrum royalties and rents of land acquired by the central government will be distributed equally among the citizens of India, and every month this money will be deposited directly into your bank account. The remaining 35% will be used only to improve the military. When you receive the amount, its entry will be made in the DhanVapsi Passbook.

(03) This law does not make any promise that you will get Rs. 500 or Rs. 1000 or any fixed amount per month. If the market value of minerals/spectrum or land increases, then income and rent can increase. But if the rate of minerals and rent decrease, then the amount received by the citizens every month will also be reduced.

(04) The National Mineral Royalty Officer (NMRO) will have the necessary staff and authority to fix, collect mineral royalties and rent of government lands to deposit it into the bank accounts of all citizens. The Prime Minister will appoint the NMRO, but if you are not getting this money on time or for any other reason you want to change the existing NMRO by someone else, then you will be able to register your opinion by going to Patwari office with the DhanVapsi Passbook. You will also be able to give your opinion through SMS, ATM or mobile app.

(05) You can cancel your opinion on any day by going to the Patwari office, and you can give your opinion for any other candidate for the post of NMRO on any day. When you register yes to a candidate or cancel your previous yes, Patwari will make its entry in your DhanVapsi Passbook.

(06) After the passing of this law, if the NMRO or his staff commits any misappropriation, corruption or there comes a complaint against him or his staff in any other matter and if your name is in the voter list, then you can be called for jury duty. In jury duty, you will have to listen to the argument, see the evidence presented by the accused, the victim, the witnesses and the lawyers of both the sides and give the verdict/penalty or release.

(07) The NMRO will conduct open auction of all mines, spectrum, government land all over India. He will prepare the outline of the lands owned by the central government and will also decide the length of the lease on all these lands. But the NMRO will not have any rights over the water resources.

(08) The NMRO will collect royalties and rent every month from every person or company that will have mines, spectrum, government land, etc. on lease and deposit the collected amount in the bank accounts of all adult citizens of India every month. All citizens will get almost equal amount, but this amount may be less or more depending on the age of the person, his number of son or daughter, disability, etc. The distribution ratio is given in the following clauses.

(09) In some cases, citizens residing in a state may get an additional amount from the amount received from the mineral and land of their state, but this amount will not be more than twice the amount that all citizens of the country are receiving. And in areas that are bordered by enemy countries or citizens residing in remote areas can also get extra money from the amount to be distributed. But except for the above exceptions, all other citizens will get an equal share.

(10) This law will only apply to mines, spectrum and lands under the Central Government. But water resources under the Central Government will remain outside the purview of this law. This law will also not apply to the mines and lands under the authority of the state, municipalities, districts, tehsils, gram panchayats. The Chief Minister, the Mayor and the Sarpanch can implement the same law to distribute the minerals royalties and rent of lands owned by the government buildings of state/city/district/tehsil/village to the citizens of their state/city/district/tehsil/village, or they need not do that.

[Comment: Collectors can create such a system that voters can register their acceptance through SMS, ATM and mobile app.

Range Voting — The Prime Minister or the Chief Minister can create such a system that voters can score between -100 to 100 points to a candidate. If the voter only registers yes, it will be considered equal to 100. If the voter does not register his acceptance, it will be considered as zero. But if the voter gives points then only the marks given by him will be valid. This range voting process is superior to the acceptance system, and provides immunity from Arrow's Useless Impossibility Theorem.]
