### [1] Minerals

<b>[a] Gautam, Vipul. "A post on royalties from minerals under Central and State governments." 3 April 2022.</b> <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/groups/179774627122206/posts/502769448156054/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/179774627122206/posts/502769448156054/</a>.

Here, Vipul Gautam finds, by looking at government data, that both the Central and State governments receive ~Rs. 50,000 crores as royalties per year. There are reasons for why I think we can avail more royalties from minerals. 
1. Conversations with staff working at mining companies reveals that only 1-50% of mining is on-books (being conducted legally) and so government isn't receiving royalties for the rest of the illegal mining (50-99% of total). Hence, as the government takes steps to reduce illegal mining this royalty rate will increase by anywhere between [no increase] to [anywhere between 10x and 100x]. 
2. Any attempt at opening a mining company will involve you (1) bribing the licensing authority (e.g. Coal Minister for mining coal) and/or (2) being connected with local gangsters. The licensing authority's arbitrary decision on granting you mining license (influenced by his nexus with existing mining companies) and the role of mafia make mining a closed industry. Making it an open industry by removing such crony-favourable licensing laws and implementing trial by jury to end the role of mafia will increase competition in the industry and drive up royalty rates in auctions. An observation of how mining auctions are rigged: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mehtarahulc/posts/pfbid022LcaSvhXHChPqyEqb6JThKMKceL3VYtSmqEaTdE6Ghd4Hck87gJUhrmhxCtZzXEDl">Mehta, Rahul. How mineral royalty theft is implemented?. 2020, May 5</a>.

<b>[b] Kundu, Sridhar, "A Note on the Estimated Value of Government-Owned Natural Resources in India". CBGA. 2014.</b> <a href = "http://www.cbgaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Estimated-Value-of-Government-Owned-Natural-Resources-in-India.pdf">http://www.cbgaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Estimated-Value-of-Government-Owned-Natural-Resources-in-India.pdf</a>. 

Here, Sridhar Kundu estimates the total value of all explored hydrocarbons (coal, crude oil, natural gas, etc.) and major mines and minerals in India to be at ~Rs. 5,011.6 lakh crore using Indian Minerals Book 2011 (published by Indian Bureau of Mines, Government of India).

Now, as time progresses we may find more mines and the market price of minerals and hydrocarbons also changes, so this price will change (likely go up with time). But for the purpose of this post, I'll assume only those mines which have been explored and (possibly) 2014 prices which Sridhar had used.

I have chosen 9 broad scenarios to cover how much royalty can we avail in terms of (1) % royalty/profit of market price we can avail and (2) speed of exploitation of these natural resources: if we can avail 25% of the market price at royalty, or 50% or 75% and if we choose to exploit all explored mines in 250 years, or 500 years, or 1,000 years. Now, of course these are not the only scenarios and the royalty rate and speed of extraction will depend on what the voters of India want, what technology can offer and what the general market of these minerals has to offer, but I have chosen these 3x3 = 9 scenarios to cover a broad spectrum of choices we have. 

Note: exploiting all mines in 250/500/1000 years doesn't mean India will have no resources after that time since (1) more mines will be explored and (2) we'll discover new/more efficient ways to use old/new minerals to fulfill our needs.

Following is the amount we'll be able to avail for each of these scenarios on a per adult citizen per month basis considering 95 crore adult citizens:

1. 25% royalty, exploit in 250 years = Rs. 440
2. 25% royalty, exploit in 500 years = Rs. 220
3. 25% royalty, exploit in 1,000 years = Rs. 110
4. 50% royalty, exploit in 250 years = Rs. 880
5. 50% royalty, exploit in 500 years = Rs. 440
6. 50% royalty, exploit in 1,000 years = Rs. 220
7. 75% royalty, exploit in 250 years = Rs. 1,319
8. 75% royalty, exploit in 500 years = Rs. 660
9. 75% royalty, exploit in 1,000 years = Rs. 330

So we can get Rs. 110 per adult citizen per month to Rs. 1,319 per adult citizen per month. And of course, this price will change as we change as the market price of natural resources change but it gives us a ballpark.

### [2] Public Land

<b>"Public Wealth Wiki." landwiki, . 21 Oct 2019, 07:52 UTC. 5 Aug 2022, 16:42.</b> <a href = "http://wiki.dhanvapasi.com/index.php?title=Public_Wealth_Wiki&oldid=789">http://wiki.dhanvapasi.com/index.php?title=Public_Wealth_Wiki&oldid=789</a>.

Total value of surplus public land = Rs. 340 lakh crore. I assumed a rent of 3% per annum for this estimate (which is roughly the market rate).

This figure of Rs. 340 lakh crore has been calculated by <a href="https://www.zaubacorp.com/company/FREE-A-BILLION-PRIVATE-LIMITED/U72900MH2012PTC226614">Free A Billion Pvt. Ltd.</a>. One should be wary of this figure because, on one of their sister organization's website, they say, "<a href = "https://wiki.dhanvapasi.com/index.php/Public_Wealth_Wiki#Land_2">The data on the unused public lands was collected by researchers at Free A Billion from authoritative governmental and non-governmental sources. These sources include Parliamentary Questions, data collected by various NGOs and think-tanks, government databases, information available from various Ministries and Departments of the Government of India.</a>" Now, I don't have full faith on this estimate because they have not released the exact sources they have used but I think their estimate makes sense: Recently, <a href = "https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-much-land-does-indian-govt-own-officials-building-inventory-railways-biggest-landowner/story-NTUmFHp2xFXoB2lZRbv5TP.html">the Central government said that the total land owned by 41 of the 51 Union ministries and 22 of over 300 PSEs is 13,505 square kilometers</a>. (For reference, the total area of Delhi is 1,483 square kilometers. So the Central government owns land equal to ~9 Delhi's.) If, say, 100% of it is empty (it isn't, but say hypothetically), then the value of this property will have to be ~Rs. 2,500 per square feet for the total land to be valued at Rs. 340 lakh crore. Now, a lot of Central government's land is in posh areas of Delhi and state capitals where property rates can go upto 20 times this rate. I'd guess even if 10-20% of it is empty, the value of the total land owned by the Central government can be close to Rs. 340 lakh crores. Another important point to note here is that this data still misses 10 Union ministries, some MoD land (for security reasons) and more than 280 PSEs. Hence, I think their estimate makes sense. 

This excludes potential  royalties from land leased currently. E.g. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/north/story/delhi-airport-land-deal-scam-cag-aviation-ministry-103088-2012-05-23">Government of India gave 4,799.09 acre of prime land to, its private sector partner, DIAL for development of Delhi airport for a paltry lease rent of Rs. 4,79,909 per year for 60 years</a>. Similarly, other cronies also grab public land during auctions at the price of peanuts. One way in which this is done is: the government officer responsible for cutting the plots to be auctioned will make sure that all plots are large enough to exclude most Indians from participating in the auction. The land rent received will increase once these backroom deals with cronies end. 

As this surplus public land comes for sale into the real estate market, it'll drive down the cost of land and also rent and for this reason I have taken a range of 50% of current price to 100% of current price while calculating the income from land rent. This will reduce the land rent citizens will get via this law but will indirectly benefit citizens as they'll be able to buy/rent real estate at a proportionaly cheaper cost. 

### [3] PSUs

<b>"Profit of PSUs surges over 37% to Rs 1.89 lakh cr in FY21: Govt". Times Now. 15 March 2022.</b> <a href = "https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/companies/profit-of-psus-surges-over-37-to-rs-1-89-lakh-cr-in-fy21-govt-article-90219227">https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/companies/profit-of-psus-surges-over-37-to-rs-1-89-lakh-cr-in-fy21-govt-article-90219227</a>.

This does not include profits of State Government PSUs.

PSUs riddled with inefficiency and corruption reduce the net profit citizens (the real shareholders of PSUs) can receive as dividends. Hence, citizens' direct control over their directors by giving citizens' the right to elect and expel directors anytime will reduce this corruption and inefficiency and will increase their profits and the amount that citizens' can take as income. For this reason, I have taken a range of 100% to 200% of current PSU profits while calculating the income.

### [4] Spectrum

<b>Department of Telecommunications. "Annual Report". 2012-2017.</b> <a href="https://dot.gov.in/reports-statistic/2471">https://dot.gov.in/reports-statistic/2471</a>.

I took an average of Demartment of Telecommunication's annual non-tax revenue from 2012 to 2017, which came out around Rs. 40,000 crore. This will change widely as and when new bands are auctioned.

Some of this Rs. 40,000 crore would have come from profits of PSUs under DoT but it won't change the total amount by much since most DoT PSUs are running at losses. For now I've assumed all of it as spectrum royalties but I'll update this figure soon so that it is more accurate.
