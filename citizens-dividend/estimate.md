    <td> 1. Conversations with staff working at mining companies reveals that only 1-10% of mining is on-books (being conducted legally) and so government isn't receiving royalties for the rest of the illegal mining (90-99% of total). Hence, as the government takes steps to reduce illegal mining this royalty rate will increase by anywhere between [no increase] to [anywhere between 10x and 100x]. <br> 2. Any attempt at opening a mining company will involve you bribing the licensing authority (e.g. Coal Minister for mining coal) and his arbitrary decision on granting you mining license (influenced by his nexus with existing mining companies) make minign a closed industry riddled by mafia. Making it an open industry by removing such crony-favourable licensing laws and implementing trial by jury to end the role of mafia will increase competition in the industry and drive up royalty rates in auctions. <br> 3. An observation of how mining auctions are rigged: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mehtarahulc/posts/pfbid022LcaSvhXHChPqyEqb6JThKMKceL3VYtSmqEaTdE6Ghd4Hck87gJUhrmhxCtZzXEDl">Mehta, Rahul.

    <td>2. Total value of surplus public land = Rs. 340 lakh crore. I assumed a rent of 2% per annum for this estimate (which is roughly the market rate). <br> 2. This figure of Rs. 340 lakh crore has been calculated by "<a href="https://www.zaubacorp.com/company/FREE-A-BILLION-PRIVATE-LIMITED/U72900MH2012PTC226614">Free A Billion</a>". <br> 3. This excludes potential  royalties from land leased currently. E.g. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/north/story/delhi-airport-land-deal-scam-cag-aviation-ministry-103088-2012-05-23">Government of India gave 4,799.09 acre of prime land to, its private sector partner, DIAL for development of Delhi airport for a paltry lease rent of Rs. 4,79,909 per year for 60 years</a> Similarly, other cronies also grab public land during auctions at the price of peanuts. The land rent received will increase once these backroom deals with cronies. <br> 4. As this surplus public land comes for sale into the real estate market, it'll drive down the cost of land and also rent. This will reduce the land rent citizens will get via this law but will indirectly benefit citizens as they'll be able to buy/rent real esttate at a proportionally cheaper cost.</td>

    <td>1. This does not include profits of State Government PSUs. <br> 2. PSUs riddled with inefficiency and corruption reduced the net profit citizens (the real shareholders of PSUs) can receive out as dividends. Hence, citizens' direct control over their directors by giving citizens' the right to elect and expel directors anytime will reduce this corruption and inefficiency and will increase their profits and the amount that citizens' can take as dividends.</td>
