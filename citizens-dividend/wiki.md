## Introduction

Some 23 years ago, Rahul Mehta, a Gujarat-based software developer and politician, came up with a proposed law that he named “Mineral Royalties for Citizens and Military”, or MRCM in short (later named Dhanvapsi Passbook). This proposal would allow two-thirds of the royalty payments from mining and wireless spectrum, rent collected from surplus public land and profits of PSEs would be dispensed as monthly payments to all Indians above the age of seven. The remaining third would be allocated for the military. He formed a “Right to Recall Group”, which is now “Right to Recall Party”, a party registered with the ECI. He started to publicize MRCM and other laws under this banner on YouTube and Facebook.

### Minerals

Gautam [1] finds, by looking at government data, that both the Central and State governments receive ~Rs. 50,000 crores as royalties per year. There are reasons for why I think we can avail more royalties from minerals.

1.  Conversations with staff working at mining companies reveals that only 1-50% of mining is on-books (being conducted legally) and so government isn't receiving royalties for the rest of the illegal mining (50-99% of total). Hence, as the government takes steps to reduce illegal mining this royalty rate will increase by anywhere between [no increase] to [anywhere between 10x and 100x].
2.  Any attempt at opening a mining company will involve you (1) bribing the licensing authority (e.g. Coal Minister for mining coal) and/or (2) being connected with local gangsters. The licensing authority's arbitrary decision on granting you mining license (influenced by his nexus with existing mining companies) and the role of mafia make mining a closed industry. Making it an open industry by removing such crony-favourable licensing laws and implementing trial by jury to end the role of mafia will increase competition in the industry and drive up royalty rates in auctions. [2] is an observation of how mining auctions are rigged.

Kundu [3] estimates the total value of all explored hydrocarbons (coal, crude oil, natural gas, etc.) and major mines and minerals in India to be at ~Rs. 5,011.6 lakh crore using the Indian Minerals Book 2011 (published by Indian Bureau of Mines, Government of India).

Now, as time progresses we may find more mines and the market price of minerals also changes, so this price will change (likely go up with time). But for now, I’ll assume only those mines which have been explored and (possibly) 2014 prices which Sridhar had used.

I have chosen 6 broad scenarios to cover how much royalty can we avail in terms of % royalty or profit of market price we can avail and speed of exploitation of these natural resources: if we can avail 25% or 50% of the market price as royalty or profits and if we choose to exploit all explored mines in 250 years, or 500 years, or 1,000 years. Now, of course these are not the only scenarios and the royalty rate and speed of extraction will depend on what the voters of India want, what technology can offer and what the general market of these minerals has to offer, but I have chosen these 3 x 3 = 9 scenarios to cover a broad spectrum of choices we have.

Before I move on to show you the estimates I got for these scenarios, let me cover some doubts you might have over the numbers I chose here. Firstly, the 25% or 50% royalty or profit might seem unrealistic or an overestimation of what we can avail, especially if you consider the low-ball royalties our government charges for mining rights currently. But once the citizens get such a dividend, a political demand for higher royalty payments will emerge automatically. Additionally, our state-owned mining companies can out bid nearly all private mining companies as both its royalties and profits are disbursed to the same entity (the citizens) and so no zero-sum game exists unlike when private companies participate in the bids. Secondly, exploiting all minerals in 250, or 500, or 1,000 years does not mean that India will be left with no resources to manufacture goods afterwards. This is because history has taught us that we’ll continue to explore and find new ores and also figure out new ways of exploiting other materials, more efficient methods of mining and more efficient manufacturing processes.

Now that I might have convinced you why the scenarios I chose make sense, here are the estimates of what we’ll be able to avail for each of these scenarios on a per adult citizen per month basis (considering 95 crore adult citizens):

<table>

<tbody>

<tr>

<th>Royalty/profit</th>

<th>Years to exploit</th>

<th>Rs. per adult per month</th>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>25%</td>

<td>250</td>

<td>Rs. 440</td>

<td>500</td>

<td>Rs. 660</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>75%</td>

<td>1000</td>

<td>Rs. 330</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

So we can get Rs. 110 per adult citizen per month to Rs. 1,319 per adult citizen per month. And of course, this price will change as we change as the market price of natural resources change but it gives us a ballpark.

### Public Land

Total value of surplus public land = Rs. 340 lakh crore. I assumed a rent of 3% per annum for this estimate (which is roughly the market rate).

A company registered by the name of [Free A Billion Pvt. Ltd.](https://www.zaubacorp.com/company/FREE-A-BILLION-PRIVATE-LIMITED/U72900MH2012PTC226614) set out some researchers to estimate surplus public land. One of their sister organization says that they estimated total surplus public land (of both the Central and State governments) to be at Rs. 340 lakh crore. [4] Adding to this estimate, they say

> The data on the unused public lands was collected by researchers at Free A Billion from authoritative governmental and non-governmental sources. These sources include Parliamentary Questions, data collected by various NGOs and think-tanks, government databases, information available from various Ministries and Departments of the Government of India.

I don't have full faith on this estimate because they have not released the exact sources they have used but I think their estimate makes sense and now I'll explain why I think so.

A few years ago, the Central government actually came up with a figure of how much land 41 of their 51 ministries and 22 of over 300 PSEs own, and it was 13,505 square kilometers. [5] For reference, the total area of Delhi is 1,483 square kilometers. So the Central government owns land equal to ~9 Delhi's.

If, say, 100% of it is vacant (it isn't, but say hypothetically), then the value of this property will have to be ~Rs. 2,500 per square feet for the total land to be valued at Rs. 340 lakh crore. A lot of Central government's land is in prime areas of New Delhi and state capitals where property rates can go upto 20 times this rate. If they are, on an average, 5 times this rate of Rs. 2,500 per square feet, even 20% vacant land will make the value of surplus land at Rs. 340 lakh crores. On top of that, this figure still misses 10 Union ministries, some MoD land (for security reasons), more than 280 Central PSEs and all the land owned by State governments and their PSEs. Hence, I'd guess even if 10% of the total public land is vacant, the value of the total surplus public land can be close to Rs. 340 lakh crores, or maybe even more.

Now, we don't know for sure if we have 10% land lying vacant because the government hasn't released the data but we do have some idea of how muhc could be vacant based on data on some ministries and departments. According to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India [6]

> The Ministries of Railways and Defence, respectively, have 43,000 hectares and 32,780 hectares of land lying vacant, without even any proposed use [...] the 13 major port trusts have 14,728 hectares of land lying idle.

To be consistent with the units I have been using, the Ministry of Railways has 430 square kilometers, Ministry of Defense has 327.8 square kilometers and the port trusts have 147.28 square kilometers of vacant un-utilised land. This totals to 905.08 square kilometers, or 6.7% of total declared land of the Central government (13,505 square kilometers). For reference, the Ministry of Railways declared having 2,929.6 square kilometers of land in total, so if 430 of it is vacant then that makes 14.6% of Ministry of Railways land vacant. One important point to note here is that railway land, military bases and ports aren't in the prime areas of cities unlike other land owned by the government. I haven't been able to find this CAG report, so I don't know if the CAG came up with figures of vacant land for other ministries which are more likely to have land in prime areas. Once I find it, I'll post an update on this newsletter.

This excludes potential royalties from land leased currently. E.g. Government of India gave 4,799.09 acre of prime land to, its private sector partner, DIAL for development of Delhi airport for a paltry lease rent of Rs. 4,79,909 per year for 60 years. [7] Similarly, other cronies also grab public land during auctions at the price of peanuts. One way in which this is done is: the government officer responsible for cutting the plots to be auctioned will make sure that all plots are large enough to exclude most Indians from participating in the auction. The land rent received will increase once these backroom deals with cronies end.

As this surplus public land comes for sale into the real estate market, it'll drive down the cost of land and also rent and for this reason I have taken a range of 50% of current price to 100% of current price while calculating the income from land rent. This will reduce the land rent citizens will get via this law but will indirectly benefit citizens as they'll be able to buy/rent real estate at a proportionaly cheaper cost.

### PSUs

For the FY 2021, profits of Central PSUs totaled to Rs. 1.89 lakh crore. [8] This does not include profits of State Government PSUs.

PSUs riddled with inefficiency and corruption reduce the net profit citizens (the real shareholders of PSUs) can receive as dividends. Hence, citizens' direct control over their directors by giving citizens' the right to elect and expel directors anytime will reduce this corruption and inefficiency and will increase their profits and the amount that citizens' can take as income. For this reason, I have taken a range of 100% to 200% of current PSU profits while calculating the income.

### Spectrum

I took an average of Demartment of Telecommunication's annual non-tax revenue from 2012 to 2017, which came out around Rs. 40,000 crore. [9] This will change widely as and when new bands are auctioned.

Some of this Rs. 40,000 crore would have come from profits of PSUs under DoT but it won't change the total amount by much since most DoT PSUs are running at losses. For now I've assumed all of it as spectrum royalties but I'll update this figure soon so that it is more accurate.

### % increase in income of Indian households

If we receive something in the middle, say Rs. 1,000 per adult per month and if, say an average Indian household has 1 earning member earning Rs. 10,000 a month and consists of 3 adults and 2 children, then that household will see their income rise by 10%. Now, I'll show the % increase in incomes for 2 income groups which comprise majority of the Indian population who also happen to be the greatest beneficiaries of the Dhanvapsi Passbook:
