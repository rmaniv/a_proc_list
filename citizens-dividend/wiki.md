## Introduction

Some 23 years ago, Rahul Mehta, a Gujarat-based software developer and politician, came up with a proposed law that he named “Mineral Royalties for Citizens and Military”, or MRCM in short (later named Dhanvapsi Passbook). This proposal would allow two-thirds of the royalty payments from mining and wireless spectrum, rent collected from surplus public land and profits of PSEs would be dispensed as monthly payments to all Indians above the age of seven. The remaining third would be allocated for the military. He formed a “Right to Recall Group”, which is now “Right to Recall Party”, a party registered with the ECI. He started to publicize MRCM and other laws under this banner on YouTube and Facebook.

Comment: This draft has two parts - (I) General Instructions for Citizens, (II) Instructions for Citizens and Officers. Comments are not part of this law. Citizens and officials can use the comments for guidelines.

### Part - I: General Instructions for All Citizens

(01) Every voter will receive a DhanVapsi Passbook within 30 days of the publication of this statute in the gazette.

(02) After this law is published in the gazette, 65% of the amount received from the mineral royalties, spectrum royalties and rents of land acquired by the central government will be distributed equally among the citizens of India, and every month this money will be deposited directly into your bank account. The remaining 35% will be used only to improve the military. When you receive the amount, its entry will be made in the DhanVapsi Passbook.

(03) This law does not make any promise that you will get Rs. 500 or Rs. 1000 or any fixed amount per month. If the market value of minerals/spectrum or land increases, then income and rent can increase. But if the rate of minerals and rent decrease, then the amount received by the citizens every month will also be reduced.

(04) The National Mineral Royalty Officer (NMRO) will have the necessary staff and authority to fix, collect mineral royalties and rent of government lands to deposit it into the bank accounts of all citizens. The Prime Minister will appoint the NMRO, but if you are not getting this money on time or for any other reason you want to change the existing NMRO by someone else, then you will be able to register your opinion by going to Patwari office with the DhanVapsi Passbook. You will also be able to give your opinion through SMS, ATM or mobile app.

(05) You can cancel your opinion on any day by going to the Patwari office, and you can give your opinion for any other candidate for the post of NMRO on any day. When you register yes to a candidate or cancel your previous yes, Patwari will make its entry in your DhanVapsi Passbook.

(06) After the passing of this law, if the NMRO or his staff commits any misappropriation, corruption or there comes a complaint against him or his staff in any other matter and if your name is in the voter list, then you can be called for jury duty. In jury duty, you will have to listen to the argument, see the evidence presented by the accused, the victim, the witnesses and the lawyers of both the sides and give the verdict/penalty or release.

(07) The NMRO will conduct open auction of all mines, spectrum, government land all over India. He will prepare the outline of the lands owned by the central government and will also decide the length of the lease on all these lands. But the NMRO will not have any rights over the water resources.

(08) The NMRO will collect royalties and rent every month from every person or company that will have mines, spectrum, government land, etc. on lease and deposit the collected amount in the bank accounts of all adult citizens of India every month. All citizens will get almost equal amount, but this amount may be less or more depending on the age of the person, his number of son or daughter, disability, etc. The distribution ratio is given in the following clauses.

(09) In some cases, citizens residing in a state may get an additional amount from the amount received from the mineral and land of their state, but this amount will not be more than twice the amount that all citizens of the country are receiving. And in areas that are bordered by enemy countries or citizens residing in remote areas can also get extra money from the amount to be distributed. But except for the above exceptions, all other citizens will get an equal share.

(10) This law will only apply to mines, spectrum and lands under the Central Government. But water resources under the Central Government will remain outside the purview of this law. This law will also not apply to the mines and lands under the authority of the state, municipalities, districts, tehsils, gram panchayats. The Chief Minister, the Mayor and the Sarpanch can implement the same law to distribute the minerals royalties and rent of lands owned by the government buildings of state/city/district/tehsil/village to the citizens of their state/city/district/tehsil/village, or they need not do that. This law will not be applicable to money made from water or distribution of water.

(13.2) During the lease time, NLRO will revise the rent every 3 years based on % change in the land prices in the 1sq km area around that plot and % change in prime lending interest rate from the day the plot was leased and the day when rent revision occurs.

(13.3) After the end of the lease period, the mineral royalty officer will conduct a new auction, in which the existing lease holder will get the following additional benefits:

(13.3.1) His tender weight will be multiplied from 1.1 to 1.5, depending on how many years he has paid the rent.

(13.3.2) After the auction is over, he can raise his bid within 3 months.

(13.4) If the plot is held by an existing entity, the entity will get 25% plus (25% * lease in months /300), maximum of 50%, bonus in the bid i.e. its bid will be multiplied with 1.25 to 1.50, but no more.

(13.5) If the plot is currently being used and occupied, NLRO will take the mean land price in past 3 years of sale in 1 km area round the plot and decide the price of plot and set (market_price * prime_interest_rate/3) as yearly rent for next 10 years. The rents will be revised every 3 years. After 10 years, rules stated from 13.1 onwards of this section will apply.

NMRO will also get income from all other mines of the country, crude oil wells etc.

(15.2) Mineral royalty and land rent received by the NMRO shall be distributed among the army, in the states and among the citizens of India in the same proportion as described in the sections relating to land rent distribution.

(16) Disposal of complaints by the mineral royalty officer and his staff by a jury

(16.1) The NMRO shall appoint a district jury administrator for each district, a state jury administrator for each state and a national jury administrator for India.

[Comment: District, state and national jury administrators will be under the DhanVapsi passbook and using the "Vote Vaapsi" section given in this passbook, the citizen can give his opinion to replace any of the above officers with another person. Its procedure is given in section 19 of this law.]

(17) Eligibility criteria for the post of NMRO and Jury Administrator:

(17.1) For NMRO and National Jury Administrator: Any citizen of India who is more than 35 years of age can apply for the post of National Mineral Royalty Officer or National Jury Administrator.

(17.2) For Jury Administrator: Any citizen of India who is more than 30 years of age can apply for the post of District and State Jury Administrator.

(18) If any citizen of the eligibility criteria given in Section 17 submits an affidavit to the District Collector Office either himself or through a lawyer, then the District Collector will submit the affidavit and will scan it to put it on PM’s website for a fee equal to the amount to be deposited in the election of the MP.

(19) Voter registering YES to support candidates:

(19.1) Any citizen can go to Patwari office with his DhanVapsi Passbook on any day and register YES in support of the candidate for the post of NMRO, District Jury Administrator, State, and National Jury Administrator. Patwari will enter the voter's YES in his computer and DhanVapsi passbook. Patwari will put the voters' YES along with the names of the candidates and the voter's ID number on the district's website. A voter can give opinion for a maximum of 5 persons of his choice from among candidates for a post.

(19.2) The voter will pay Rs. 3 fee for registering acceptance (YES). The fee for BPL card holder will be Re. 1.

(19.3) If a voter comes to cancel his opinion, Patwari will cancel one or more names without any fee.

(19.4) On the 5th of each month, the Collector will publish a count of the YES received by each of the candidates received in the previous month. Patwari will perform this demonstration of the opinion (YES) of his area every Monday. The opinion for the NMRO and National Jury Administrator will also be demonstrated by the Cabinet Secretary on the 5th of each month.

[Comment: Collectors can create such a system that voters can register their acceptance through SMS, ATM and mobile app.

Range Voting — The Prime Minister or the Chief Minister can create such a system that voters can score between -100 to 100 points to a candidate. If the voter only registers yes, it will be considered equal to 100. If the voter does not register his acceptance, it will be considered as zero. But if the voter gives points then only the marks given by him will be valid. This range voting process is superior to the acceptance system, and provides immunity from Arrow's Useless Impossibility Theorem.] 

(20) Appointment and removal of National Mineral Officer and Jury Administrator:

(20.1) For NMRO and National Jury Administrator: If a candidate receives more than 35% of the YES of all the voters (all voters, not only those who have given opinion) in the voter list of the country. And if these YES are also 1% more than the incumbent officer, then the Prime Minister can remove the incumbent officer and appoint the candidate with the highest approval to the relevant post, or PM may resign from his/her post. The final decision on the appointment will be made by the Prime Minister.

(20.2) For the State Jury Administrator: If more than 35% of all the voters in the state's voter list register YES in favor of a candidate and if this number of approvals is also 1% more than the incumbent, then the NMRO may appoint that person to the post of State Jury Administrator.

(20.3) For District Jury Administrator: If more than 35% of all the voters in the voter list of the district register YES in favor of a candidate and if this number is also 1% more than the incumbent, then the NMRO may appoint that person to the post of District Jury Administrator.

(21.1) If any voter wants any change in this law then he will be able to submit an affidavit for this in the Collector's office. The district collector will scan and put the affidavit to the Chief Minister's website along with the voter ID number of the voter at a fee of Rs 20 per page.

(21.2) If any voter wants to register his approval on an affidavit submitted under Section 21.1, he may register his Yes/No by paying a fee of Rs 3 in the Patwari office. Patwari will register it and put Yes/No along with voter's voter ID on the Chief Minister's website.

[Comment: 4 years after the enactment of this law, if there is a positive and decisive change in the system, then any citizen can submit an affidavit under section 15 of this law, in which those activists will be given a reasonable reward as a consolation who have made efforts to implement this law. If an activist is not alive then the reward will be given to his / her nominee. This consideration may be in the form of a memento / citation etc. or some other form. If 51% of the citizens of the state register YES on this affidavit, then the Prime Minister / Chief Minister can, or may not, issue orders to implement it.]

### Minerals

Gautam [1] finds, by looking at government data, that both the Central and State governments receive ~Rs. 50,000 crores as royalties per year. There are reasons for why I think we can avail more royalties from minerals. 
1. Conversations with staff working at mining companies reveals that only 1-50% of mining is on-books (being conducted legally) and so government isn't receiving royalties for the rest of the illegal mining (50-99% of total). Hence, as the government takes steps to reduce illegal mining this royalty rate will increase by anywhere between [no increase] to [anywhere between 10x and 100x]. 
2. Any attempt at opening a mining company will involve you (1) bribing the licensing authority (e.g. Coal Minister for mining coal) and/or (2) being connected with local gangsters. The licensing authority's arbitrary decision on granting you mining license (influenced by his nexus with existing mining companies) and the role of mafia make mining a closed industry. Making it an open industry by removing such crony-favourable licensing laws and implementing trial by jury to end the role of mafia will increase competition in the industry and drive up royalty rates in auctions. [2] is an observation of how mining auctions are rigged.

Kundu [3] estimates the total value of all explored hydrocarbons (coal, crude oil, natural gas, etc.) and major mines and minerals in India to be at ~Rs. 5,011.6 lakh crore using the Indian Minerals Book 2011 (published by Indian Bureau of Mines, Government of India).

Now, as time progresses we may find more mines and the market price of minerals also changes, so this price will change (likely go up with time). But for now, I’ll assume only those mines which have been explored and (possibly) 2014 prices which Sridhar had used.

I have chosen 6 broad scenarios to cover how much royalty can we avail in terms of % royalty or profit of market price we can avail and speed of exploitation of these natural resources: if we can avail 25% or 50% of the market price as royalty or profits and if we choose to exploit all explored mines in 250 years, or 500 years, or 1,000 years. Now, of course these are not the only scenarios and the royalty rate and speed of extraction will depend on what the voters of India want, what technology can offer and what the general market of these minerals has to offer, but I have chosen these 3 x 3 = 9 scenarios to cover a broad spectrum of choices we have. 

Before I move on to show you the estimates I got for these scenarios, let me cover some doubts you might have over the numbers I chose here. Firstly, the 25% or 50% royalty or profit might seem unrealistic or an overestimation of what we can avail, especially if you consider the low-ball royalties our government charges for mining rights currently. But once the citizens get such a dividend, a political demand for higher royalty payments will emerge automatically. Additionally, our state-owned mining companies can out bid nearly all private mining companies as both its royalties and profits are disbursed to the same entity (the citizens) and so no zero-sum game exists unlike when private companies participate in the bids. Secondly, exploiting all minerals in 250, or 500, or 1,000 years does not mean that India will be left with no resources to manufacture goods afterwards. This is because history has taught us that we’ll continue to explore and find new ores and also figure out new ways of exploiting other materials, more efficient methods of mining and more efficient manufacturing processes. 

Now that I might have convinced you why the scenarios I chose make sense, here are the estimates of what we’ll be able to avail for each of these scenarios on a per adult citizen per month basis (considering 95 crore adult citizens):

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Royalty/profit</th>
    <th>Years to exploit</th>
    <th>Rs. per adult per month</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>25%</td>
    <td>250</td>
    <td>Rs. 440</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>25%</td>
    <td>500</td>
    <td>Rs. 220</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>25%</td>
    <td>1000</td>
    <td>Rs. 110</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>50%</td>
    <td>250</td>
    <td>Rs. 880</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>50%</td>
    <td>500</td>
    <td>Rs. 440</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>50%</td>
    <td>1000</td>
    <td>Rs. 220</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>75%</td>
    <td>250</td>
    <td>Rs. 1,319</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>75%</td>
    <td>500</td>
    <td>Rs. 660</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>75%</td>
    <td>1000</td>
    <td>Rs. 330</td>
  </tr>
</table>

So we can get Rs. 110 per adult citizen per month to Rs. 1,319 per adult citizen per month. And of course, this price will change as we change as the market price of natural resources change but it gives us a ballpark.

### Public Land

Total value of surplus public land = Rs. 340 lakh crore. I assumed a rent of 3% per annum for this estimate (which is roughly the market rate).

A company registered by the name of [Free A Billion Pvt. Ltd.](https://www.zaubacorp.com/company/FREE-A-BILLION-PRIVATE-LIMITED/U72900MH2012PTC226614) set out some researchers to estimate surplus public land. One of their sister organization says that they estimated total surplus public land (of both the Central and State governments) to be at Rs. 340 lakh crore. [4] Adding to this estimate, they say

> The data on the unused public lands was collected by researchers at Free A Billion from authoritative governmental and non-governmental sources. These sources include Parliamentary Questions, data collected by various NGOs and think-tanks, government databases, information available from various Ministries and Departments of the Government of India.

I don't have full faith on this estimate because they have not released the exact sources they have used but I think their estimate makes sense and now I'll explain why I think so.

A few years ago, the Central government actually came up with a figure of how much land 41 of their 51 ministries and 22 of over 300 PSEs own, and it was 13,505 square kilometers. [5] For reference, the total area of Delhi is 1,483 square kilometers. So the Central government owns land equal to ~9 Delhi's.

If, say, 100% of it is vacant (it isn't, but say hypothetically), then the value of this property will have to be ~Rs. 2,500 per square feet for the total land to be valued at Rs. 340 lakh crore. A lot of Central government's land is in prime areas of New Delhi and state capitals where property rates can go upto 20 times this rate. If they are, on an average, 5 times this rate of Rs. 2,500 per square feet, even 20% vacant land will make the value of surplus land at Rs. 340 lakh crores. On top of that, this figure still misses 10 Union ministries, some MoD land (for security reasons), more than 280 Central PSEs and all the land owned by State governments and their PSEs. Hence, I'd guess even if 10% of the total public land is vacant, the value of the total surplus public land can be close to Rs. 340 lakh crores, or maybe even more.

Now, we don't know for sure if we have 10% land lying vacant because the government hasn't released the data but we do have some idea of how muhc could be vacant based on data on some ministries and departments. According to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India [6]

> The Ministries of Railways and Defence, respectively, have 43,000 hectares and 32,780 hectares of land lying vacant, without even any proposed use [...] the 13 major port trusts have 14,728 hectares of land lying idle.

To be consistent with the units I have been using, the Ministry of Railways has 430 square kilometers, Ministry of Defense has 327.8 square kilometers and the port trusts have 147.28 square kilometers of vacant un-utilised land. This totals to 905.08 square kilometers, or 6.7% of total declared land of the Central government (13,505 square kilometers). For reference, the Ministry of Railways declared having 2,929.6 square kilometers of land in total, so if 430 of it is vacant then that makes 14.6% of Ministry of Railways land vacant. One important point to note here is that railway land, military bases and ports aren't in the prime areas of cities unlike other land owned by the government. I haven't been able to find this CAG report, so I don't know if the CAG came up with figures of vacant land for other ministries which are more likely to have land in prime areas. Once I find it, I'll post an update on this newsletter.

This excludes potential  royalties from land leased currently. E.g. Government of India gave 4,799.09 acre of prime land to, its private sector partner, DIAL for development of Delhi airport for a paltry lease rent of Rs. 4,79,909 per year for 60 years. [7] Similarly, other cronies also grab public land during auctions at the price of peanuts. One way in which this is done is: the government officer responsible for cutting the plots to be auctioned will make sure that all plots are large enough to exclude most Indians from participating in the auction. The land rent received will increase once these backroom deals with cronies end. 

As this surplus public land comes for sale into the real estate market, it'll drive down the cost of land and also rent and for this reason I have taken a range of 50% of current price to 100% of current price while calculating the income from land rent. This will reduce the land rent citizens will get via this law but will indirectly benefit citizens as they'll be able to buy/rent real estate at a proportionaly cheaper cost. 

### PSUs

For the FY 2021, profits of Central PSUs totaled to Rs. 1.89 lakh crore. [8] This does not include profits of State Government PSUs.

PSUs riddled with inefficiency and corruption reduce the net profit citizens (the real shareholders of PSUs) can receive as dividends. Hence, citizens' direct control over their directors by giving citizens' the right to elect and expel directors anytime will reduce this corruption and inefficiency and will increase their profits and the amount that citizens' can take as income. For this reason, I have taken a range of 100% to 200% of current PSU profits while calculating the income.

### Spectrum

I took an average of Demartment of Telecommunication's annual non-tax revenue from 2012 to 2017, which came out around Rs. 40,000 crore. [9] This will change widely as and when new bands are auctioned.

Some of this Rs. 40,000 crore would have come from profits of PSUs under DoT but it won't change the total amount by much since most DoT PSUs are running at losses. For now I've assumed all of it as spectrum royalties but I'll update this figure soon so that it is more accurate.

### % increase in income of Indian households

If we receive something in the middle, say Rs. 1,000 per adult per month and if, say an average Indian household has 1 earning member earning Rs. 10,000 a month and consists of 3 adults and 2 children, then that household will see their income rise by 10%. Now, I'll show the % increase in incomes for 2 income groups which comprise majority of the Indian population who also happen to be the greatest beneficiaries of the Dhanvapsi Passbook:
