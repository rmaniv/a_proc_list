A post on royalties from minerals under Central and State governments.

The purpose of this post is to get an "extremely rough estimate" on the per capita royalty distribution that can be obtained on 2018-19 royalty revenue prices.

### List of Chapters

01) Who asserts ownership on minerals and in what manner?

02) Some examples of total royalties collected during a year

### (01) Who asserts ownership on minerals, in what manner, and on which minerals?

(01.A)  Seventh Schedule of Constitution of India provides that Central  government can regulate mines and minerals, but it is ultimately the  State governments which can keep with themselves the tax  receipts/proceeds collected from mines and minerals. This indirectly  also means that if a mineral is found on a private land (not owned by  any government) then the owner cannot extract and sell it without  getting license from the appropriate government, and without paying  royalties or rents wherever applicable in law.

(01.B)  In Bharat, minerals are categorized as fuel minerals, atomic minerals,  minor minerals, and other minerals. These other minerals are commonly  known as "major minerals" and are futher classified as metallic and  non-metallic minerals.

(01.C)  Now, I must state that in my opinion the word "minor" in the term  "minor minerals" is deliberately used to keep the citizens uninformed of  the importance of them in terms of their valuation.

The  overall valuation (total domestic market price, not royalty) of minor  minerals extracted in a year is usually at par at, or exceeds, the  overall valuation of major minerals extracted in a year. However, if a  citizen is not told or shown this overall valuation per annum fact, then  prima facie, that citizen is likely to conclude that these "minor  minerals" are  probably not of much value and use. Otherwise they would  not have been called "minor". This was the first thing that I thought of  when I came across this term "minor minerals" the very first time!

(01.D)  Exploration, extraction, leasing of mines for fuel minerals (coal,  lignite, pertroleum crude, natural gas), Major minerals and minor  minerals, are regulated by the Central law named "Mines and Minerals  (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957", henceforth as MMDR Act.

(01.E)  Imposition of royalty on Atomic minerals is done by Central government,  but royalties are collected and kept/appropriated by State governments  as per Atomic Minerals Concessions Rules, 2016 (part of MMDR Act).

(01.F)  Royalties on Major minerals are imposed by Central government, but are  collected and kept/appropriated by State governments as per Centre's  MMDR Act.

(01.G)  Royalties on minor minerals are imposed (declared) through State laws,  and are collected and kept/appropriated  by State governments as per  Centre's MMDR Act and the State's own related law and rules.

(01.H) Royalties on coal and lignite are imposed by Centre, but are collected and kept/appropriated by State governments.

(01.I)  Royalties on crude oil and natural gas are given to Centre and State  governments respectively, based on whether the area from which they are  extracted comes under Centre or State government.

(01.I)  Royalties on any type of minerals extracted from offshore areas   (territorial waters, coasts, exclusive economic zones, etc.) are  imposed, collected and kept/appropriated by Central government only.

(01.J) In short:

(01.JA)  all  royalties from ALL the minerals  extracted from onshore areas  (lands under the territory of States) ultimately ends up in the official  account of State governments, and

(01.JB)  all royalties from ALL the minerals extracted from offshore areas  ends  up in the official account of Central government.

(01.I)   On top of that, Centre or State governments impose excise duties,  various types of Cess (e.g. carbon tax), other fees for local  area/tribal development, etc., in the whole process of mineral  extraction. This is not part of royalty but is collected and  appropriated by State governments and Central governments nonetheless.

### 02 ) Who gets to levy/impose,and  keep royalty, and on which minerals?

(02.A) Total Royalties in the financial year 2018-19 given to State governments only:

(02.A1) Royalties on Coal and Lignite (link-M1) = 14,746 Cr

(02.A2) Royalties on Crude oil and natural gas (link-M2) = 13,371 Cr

(02.A3) Royalties on Major Minerals (link-M3) = 17,484 Cr

(02.A4) Royalties on Atomic Minerals (data only for Uranium) = 51 Cr

(02.A5) Royalties on Minor minerals: no consolidated data found

(02.A6) Aggregate of above royalties (excluding Minor minerals) is (02.A1) + (02.A2) + (02.A3) + (02.A4) = 45,652 Cr

(02.A7)  Note 1: for calculation of royalty on Major minerals for States which  didn't report their Royalties for 2018-19 year, I used their royalty  figures reported for 2017-18 year.

(02.B) Total Royalties given to the Central government in the year 2018-19:

(02.B1) Royalties on Coal and Lignite (link-N1): 104 Cr

(02.B2) Royalties on Crude Oil and Natural Gas (link-N1): 14,197 Cr

(02.B3)   Royalty figures for all other minerals are not provided by Central  government separately: might be around or below 400 Cr (wild guess)  based on Receipt budget figures

(02.B4) Aggregate of above royalties is  (02.B1) + (02.B2)  + (02.B3)   = 14,701 Cr

(02.C) Estimated Population of Bharat in 2021-22 =  140 Cr

(02.C1) All India per capita royalty distribution from Central share on monthly basis = 14,701 / (140x12) = <b> 8.8  Rupees </b> (emphasis mine)

(02.C2)  All India per capita royalty distribution from all States share  (excluding minor minerals) on monthly basis = 45,652 / (140x12) = <b> 27  Rupees </b> (emphasis mine)

## Land Rents

Value of total surplus government owned land (both Central + State) = Rs. 340 lakh crore (?) [[Source](https://wiki.dhanvapasi.com/index.php/Public_Wealth_Wiki#Land);  Though no public land database has been published by the govt, [Rajesh Jain](https://twitter.com/rajeshjain)'s group has put this figure on their  website. Refer the hyperlinks in Table 2 and 3 of their wiki.]

Considering  their Rs. 340 lakh crore value, and a 2% <b> per annum </b> rent on it, total  rent = <b> Rs. 404.8 per citizen per month </b>. (This excludes potential  royalties from land leased currently.)

## PSU profits

Total  profits of all Central PSUs in FY21 = Rs. 1.89 lakh crore = <b> Rs. 112.5  per citizen per month </b> (considering 140 crore citizens). [[Source](https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/companies/profit-of-psus-surges-over-37-to-rs-1-89-lakh-cr-in-fy21-govt-article-90219227)] (This doesn't include profits of State PSUs.)

## Spectrum Royalties

[placeholder]

<b> = Rs. X per citizen per month </b>

## Per citizen per month payment

Mineral royalty + Land rent + Central PSU profits + Spectrum Royalties = 8.8 + Rs. 27 + Rs. 112.5 + Rs. 404.8 + Rs. X = <b> Rs. 553.1 + X per citizen per month</b>.

(This is the crude payment that we can estimate before the Dhanvapsi Passbook law comes into effect. Once it comes into effect, many changes might occur (apart from the regular fluctuations in mineral/land rent rates). Some changes may increase these payments, for e.g. potential increase in mineral royalty rates due to pressure on government to reduce corruption in mine auctions, potential increase in PSU profits due to pressure on government to reduce inefficiency of PSUs. At the same time, there might be a decrease land rents due to decrease in land prices because of increase in supply of surplus public land. However, this effect is bound to benefit citizens by reducing the rent they themselves have to pay for their houses.)
