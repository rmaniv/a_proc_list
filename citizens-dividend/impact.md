## % increase in income of Indian households

If we receive something in the middle, say Rs. 1,000 per adult per month and if, say an average Indian household has 1 earning member earning Rs. 10,000 a month and consists of 3 adults and 2 children, then that household will see their income rise by 10%. Now, I'll show the % increase in incomes for 2 income groups which comprise majority of the Indian population who also happen to be the greatest beneficiaries of the Dhanvapsi Passbook:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Annual household income [3]</th>
    <th>Share of total households</th>
    <th>Minimum % income increase</th>
    <th>Maximum % income increase</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>less than Rs. 1,00,000</td>
    <td>poorest 16.6%</td>
    <td>More than 18%</td>
    <td>More than 60%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>between Rs. 1,00,000 and Rs. 2,00,000</td>
    <td>next 45%</td>
    <td>More than 9%</td>
    <td>More than 30%</td>
  </tr>
