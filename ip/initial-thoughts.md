# Ideas - should they be property or not

*April 17, 2022*

I'm less concerned about copyrights, more concerned about patents. The former benefits or hurts the writer and the artist while the latter benefits or hurts the inventor, and it is the latter whose welfare matters more for everyone's well-being.

The anarcho-capitalist slogan "Ideas are NOT property" is best left for fairy tales, right after their non-aggression principle. Moral arguments are pointless to discuss.

A utilitarian argument for patent rights would require a cost-benefit analysis, for which one would have to look at history and find a correlation between patent policy shifts and either crude variables used as a proxy for \"innovation\", or economic growth for which there can be a hundred confounding variables, many unknown. Thus any empirical analysis on such a subject would be utterly unreliable.

Thinking about their utility intuitively makes it hard for me to support a 20 year monopoly. But what makes me want to stick to the status quo is the fear that in the absence of patents, large corporations can leverage economies of scale to profit from an invention and leave no incentive for the inventor. 

Then come the patent trolls. ... And disapear as soon as the Congress amends [35 U.S.C. §285](https://blog.jipel.law.nyu.edu/2014/01/loser-pays-in-patent-litigation/). It currently requires defender to prove plaintiffs filed suit in bad faith (\"exceptional cases\") for getting compensated for their attorney fees. Amending the section to make the losing plaintiff always pay for it would take care of the patent trolls.

Then comes [Asetek's GPU liquid cooling patent](https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=8755179.PN.&OS=PN/8755179&RS=PN/8755179), [Amazon's one-click](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/025457073/publication/US5960411A?q=pn%3DUS5960411) and the likes. ... And disappear if the USPTO or the courts [reject them on the grounds of being "obvious"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/103). The USPTO didn't in both these cases. The US Federal Court judge [didn't invalidate](https://www.finnegan.com/en/firm/news/judge-says-cmi-can-t-invalidate-asetek-cooling-patents.html) Asetek's cooling patent on grounds of being obvious. Barnes and Nobles felt that an out of court settlement with Amazon would be better than defending themselves in court. The system doesn't seem fair. 

The EPO rejected Amazon's one-click patent, so it's not like my finding of such invention claims as being obvious are outlandish. It's my bet that most if not all plebs like me would also think like me in such cases and so I'd let a jury of peers have a final word on this. Currently, their judgement isn't final. It may be overturned in appeals. But if they had the final word, the system would be more fair. "[\[Trial by jury\] is an institution that isn't fixable because it is always new people. They're not repeat players that you can make a deal with, take care of, give their brother in-law a job. None of that. It's the cleanest institution in government.](https://youtu.be/Q5FAG68zW7U)" I think it is best to leave such subjective judgement that can influence corporate profits to this cleanest government institution.

Countries like India, which don't have this institution, should install it.
