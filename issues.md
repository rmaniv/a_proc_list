1. **Ban Electronic voting.** EVMs are vulnerable to fraud.[[1](https://indiaevm.org/paper.html)] [[2](https://youtu.be/ZlCOj1dElDY)] [[3](rahulmehta.com/evm1.pdf)] VVPAT is the costliest pen that we've invented. But even theyare vulnerable to fraud, especially the current design we have. In June 2017, a design change was made in VVPATs - from transparent glass to a black one-sided glass that shows vote slip only when light is switched-on inside. With such a glass, algorithms like [[4](http://youtu.be/YDjPI-6uhwI)]/[[5](https://twitter.com/NewsHtn/status/1117384530162176000)] can make sure that even paper votes dropped in the storage bin of the VVPAT are manipulated to match the electronic votes stored in the EVM. [[6](http://youtu.be/Lo9kUaM-ExA)] is a demonstration of this algorithm on a VVPAT-VM look-alike (not a real VVPAT-EVM). 
2. **Allow voters to publish an affidavit submitted to DM on PM and CM's website for a fee and allow them to register their cancelable YESs and NOs on those affidavits for a fee by visiting Patwari's office.** This will establish a de-facto initiative-referendum system. Using this voters can override Parliament's acts, PM and CM's Gazette notifications and SC/HC's judgements and orders and also force them to give orders as voters please -- because no MP, MLA, PM, CM, SC judge, HC judge will be willing to go against something that the majority of voters have expressed their approval for publically (i.e. majority of citizens' know that majority of citizens' support an affidavit). [[7](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1IVs2I7toaI1EbjzClssp9SOJqAYPmqSv)] is a draft of a Gazette notification that Cabinet (effectively PM/CM) can issue to implement this system.
