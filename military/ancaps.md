# The denialism of anarcho-capitalists

*July 30, 2022*

I haven’t seen a better form of denialism than believing in anarcho-capitalism or anarchy. 

An caps love to spend hours ranting how the government is stealing your wealth via taxation and then spending it however they want. But what will happen in a world without any government? One would have to rely on private security firms to own any property. 

They believe that since these private security firms will have to compete to get new customers, they’ll be more efficient in enforcing property rights than the present-day military, police and courts. What is important to note here is that these private security firms will not compete in the same way that an apple-seller competes in a world with the government enforcing private property rights. In our present-day world, an apple-seller can’t kill the apple seller to capture the market. He’ll probably land in jail if he tries to pursue such a strategy. But private security firm, in absence of the government, will pursue the strategy of simply going at war with the other private security firm to capture the market. The private security firms  with better weapons will prevail. What proof do I have? Such wars have existed throughout the history of us humans. There is anarchy at the international level.

But this doesn’t stop here. The private security firms will be in no obligation to obey your decision of not paying for their service because they have real power. They can charge you whatever they want, just like modern day governments levy taxes. Of course there will be constraints over how much can the private security firm exploit its customers. But those constrains will be no more or less than any authoritative government. 

My point is that we already live in an an cap world and the an caps are in denial that we don't.

Some an caps have come with a new line of argument: being a part of an armed tribe to protect from such exploitation. I believe almost all an caps much have seen the proof that small tribes won’t survive a day in front of large sanding armies but they choose to ignore it. The proof is the political map of the world. All such small tribes that existed once have been taken over by one standing army of a government or the other. (I do believe that having a good civilian ownership of firearms is very important and I'll cover it just in while but I don't think it is sufficient to survive in a world with modern-day weapons.)

My problem with an caps is that they want to completely renounce decades of the self-less hard-work of revolutionaries who have given us common civilians a special kind of private security firms where now majority of us common civilians can decide who the board of directors and CEOs of these private security security firms will be (in all modern-day republics), where some can vote on the policies that the board of directors of these private security firms adopt and also enforce (in all those countries, states and local governments which have the provision of citizen triggered referendums) and also enforce them (in all those countries which have jury trials and lay judges). They want to completely reverse this world order and make us go 300 years in the past. 

The way forward is not to let go of these private security firms on which most of us already have some level of control, it is to increase our control over these private security firms. And simply passing laws that increase our control over them won’t work unless we common civilians are armed to teeth. Right to bear firearms might be the only issue on which I fully agree with an caps, so let’s end it there.
