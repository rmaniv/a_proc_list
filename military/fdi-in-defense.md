## FDI in defense is as futile as relying on imports

</div>

<i> August 10, 2020 </i>

Moving towards self-reliance is inevitable if we want to get rid of the lack of control over supply and technology that comes with imported weapons. It is quite obvious now that the current government’s plan to move towards self-reliance involves “Make in India”: a camouflage for FDI. A lot of “experts”, journalists across media houses & even veterans have proposed leapfrogging to current generation technology via FDI. A clear path towards weapons which are Made in India by Indians [[1]](#footnote-1) - which I think is the only solution to the problems with imports - doesn’t seem to be in their to-do list. In this first issue of my newsletter, I’m going to describe a thought experiment which may turn into reality if we continue with our efforts at being experts in Made in India by Foreigners weapons.

Disclaimer: This account is purely born out of my imagination. Any resemblance to real world or legal entities is purely coincidental.

Axiom: hUS's national security establishment consists of hUSGov and companies manufacturing weapons in hUS (hLockheedMartin or “hLM”, hBoeing, hGeneralDynamics, hRaytheon, hNorthropGrumman etc). I might use these words interchangeably for mentioning the people involved in determining their foreign/strategic policy.

Consider the following hypothetical scenario (hat tip: [Rahul Mehta](https://twitter.com/MehtaRahulC)):

1. hIndia's (hereafter referred to as “our” and its relevant derivatives) airforce is heavily dependent on hLMIndia [[2]](#footnote-2) (a legal entity that hLM created in India to setup a manufacturing/assembling facility) for its fleet. 
2. There’s a war and we need a rapid supply of spare parts and maybe even aircrafts if the war lasts long enough.
3. The national security establishment of the hUS decides to delay help for hIndia (there may be several reasons for why this is the most likely scenario which I'll explain later) where either 
   - hLM is complicit in pursuing this strategy (the likely scenario), or
   - hUSGov puts pressure on hLM to not comply and hLM agrees for obvious reasons of not getting into a strife with rest of the national security establishment

Before moving onto an analysis of our options for responding to such a turn of events, I'd like to put out what would the hUSGov, primarily its military-industrial complex/national security establishment, gain from delaying help for hIndia. If hUS provides unhindered military support to hIndia and hIndia wins the war, then well, hIndia will save its landmass, soldiers, people and a lot of wealth. While, if hUS delays military support by hindering supply of weapon systems and/or their spare parts practically giving the opposing side an edge, hIndia will struggle until its assistance is rendered, in course of which it will lose its land, soldiers, people and a lot of wealth. The condition of the country after such loss of land, soldiers and people in the middle of a war - when there’s no way for us to survive albeit hUS’s help - will put our government at a vulnerable position: at a very weak negotiating standpoint with the hUSGov. We’ll plead for their support and will be ready to give whatever to save us from the aggressor - be it hUSD for weapons/treasury bonds (depleting our foreign exchange reserves further), our natural resources, our hIndian boots on the ground for their own future interventionist adventures, or a combination of these. This is a simple increase in their “return on investment” while none of it would be a favourable/fair trade for us. 

Now that I’ve explained why I think such a strategy makes sense for the hUS, it’s important to know if apex leaders in the world think, or have thought in the past, in a similar manner. [Here](https://archive.org/details/tragedyofgreatpo00mear/page/154) are is excerpt from the book *The Tragedy of Great Power Politics* by American International Relations scholar John Mearsheimer which talks about various leaders and countries who’ve employed or thought about employing such a strategy which he calls “bloodletting”:

Now that I *might* have convinced you on the possibility of such a scenario, it is important to look at what would be the possible options for us then. The only response I could think of other than pleading to the US - which is unfavourable as I demonstrated theoretically - is nationalizing the company hLMIndia. This strategy is doable: hIndia is not at the level that it can't exercise sovereign authority using its military and police inside its borders. The hindrance to that would be a direct/indirect military response by the hUS, which can only be deterred if we have a military that is realistically one of the strongest in the world. But it is also possible that hUS doesn't go to this extent; hence, it is also important for us to speculate whether we would be able to fulfill our demands for the ongoing war by pursuing the strategy of nationalization.

First, let's accept a demonstrable truth: no weapons manufacturer will reinvent their supply chains when they setup their plant in hIndia. They’ll import most of the components from their regular vendors in the hUS (and elsewhere, like hJapan, hSouthKorea) and assemble the aircraft/system here. In which case, the hUS can put an embargo on us by banning exports of weaponry inputs to hIndia and be successful with their strategy. This is true for some simple reasons: less importantly, it doesn't make economic sense and more importantly, it doesn't make strategic sense: the hUS will fail to achieve what they would have if they otherwise relied on the bloodletting strategy explained earlier. Also, let's accept a harsher truth: hIndia is in no position to compel the hUSGov to have the full supply chain in hIndia. No such offset policy will land into an agreement. Hence, it is safe to assume that the national security establishment of the hUS will always try to keep the supply chain distributed across the globe but limited to its own borders and its protectorates (like hJapan and hSouthKorea).

Secondly, let's get the limits of nationalization right. Nationalizing a company can, at best give us, physical custody of hLMIndia's machinery and control over the *employees who agree to work under the GoI*. I wrote "physical custody" and not "control" because it is safe to assume that activation codes for some key machinery would be kept secret by the company. It is possible that GoI's engineers activate the machinery regardless after some tinkering. I am pretty unaware of the likelihood of such a scenario and, except for the fact that I can guess that we can't be fully assured of making their machines work for practically operating their assembly line, so I would ignore this variable acting as a blockade and focus on other factors for the purpose of this blogpost; but, I'll get back on this aspect in a later one. It is more important to focus on the second italicised phrase "employees who agree to work under the GoI". There may be some managers who would have contracts (officially, maybe in the hUS) and/or understanding (unofficially) to be loyal for hLM in case such a situation arises. So, we cannot be assured of having full manegeral control over the assembly line. hGoI would have to put their own system-level and organisation level managers. I am pretty unaware of how things work in a defense production unit and I plan to invite an expert's opinion in future posts on how well can we tackle such a situation.

Regardless of the limitations of nationalization, hLMIndia's most likely decision of not establishing a full supply chain within hIndia's borders will itself render the nationalization effort futile. Thus, hUSGov can still control hGoI’s ability to fight a war, just like they will be able to do if we continue to import weapons and/or their components from them. QED.

The only benefit FDI will bring is more jobs and foreign exchange as positives but at the same time, it’ll also bring a threat of [mass repatriation](https://youtu.be/O89CvcyCjhw) without having even a marginal effect on our ability to fight a war. Hence, we should end allowing FDI in defense, or at least bring it down again to 49% so that Indians can still have the control in peacetime and we’re able to build the supply chain in India itself to make it resilient to such bloodletting.

as in the shareholders and employees of the weapon manufacturing companies are Indian citizens and are manufacturing within our borders or in one of our protectorates

This thought experiment is both country-independent & company-independent. It would be valid even if we were talking about the fictional entity hFrance instead of hUS, or hBoeingIndia instead of hLMIndia.
