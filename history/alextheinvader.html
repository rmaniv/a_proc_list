			<div class="content">&quot;RamaY&quot;<br /><br />Excerpts from Arya Chanakya by Sri Vedula Surya Narayana Sarma - Part 1.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-weight: bold">On the need to write on Artha (the 2nd purushartha in Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha)</span><br /><br />Artha (wealth/security) is the foundation to Dharma. Artha fulfills Kama (desires). By tying Dharma and Kama, realization of Artha ensures human accomplishment. Moreover, our ancestors have written in detail and much about Dharma and Moksha that there is no need for additional texts on those two purusharthas. There are very few books on Artha, and almost none on Kama. I have decided to address this inadequacy.<br /><br />I have researched various scripts/books written about Artha by Barhaspatas, Manavas, Ausanas, Ambhis, Visalaksha, Vatavyadhi (Vuddhava), Pisana (Naarada), Bharadwaja (Dronacharya), Kaunadampata (Bhishma), and Bahudanti Putra (Indra). I have researched every and any text written on wealth acquisition and management. Unfortunately all those texts focused on Dharma more than Artha.  Not only that, the methods suggested in those texts do not apply to current times.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Does it mean Dharma is not time-agnostic?</span><br /><br />Dharma and Satya are two sides of the same coin. For example all Indian coins will have the four-lions symbol on one side. The second side of the coin shows the denomination of the coin (10 Paise, 25 Piase, 50 Paise, and 1Rs etc). Here the four-lions symbolizes Satya, which is constant and beyond the concept of time. The Dharma on the other hand changes based on time, ashrama (brahmacharya, grihastha, vanaprastha etc), and varna (brahmana, kshatriya, vaisya, and sudra)<br /><br />Our ancestors have given high priority to Dharma. But as time passed the Dharma, as mentioned in the texts, has become unattainable to common public. Public interest moved away from Dharma to Artha, as a means to fulfill their desires, Kama. At this point it is very difficult to forcibly divert public attention from Artha to Dharma. In addition to that, the severe punishments prescribed in our Dharma-scripts did not help much in attracting the public into dharmic way of living. <br /><br />There is no difference between Dharma and Justice as long as the Dharma is defined with providing justice in mind. Our ancestors have written dharma-sutras keeping justice (nyaaya) in mind. But over time the commentators started interpreting these dharma-sutras in literal sense instead of them being principles of justice system. The whole process has become a blind faith, where as it is supposed to have a scientific approach.<br /><br />For example Danda-Smriti says “<span style="font-style: italic">yukta karmani chayuktasya</span> = Ayukta is punishable if he does yukta karma”. This principle has been blindly translated into caste system and interpreted as “Sudras and others are punishable if they perform Brahmanic karmas”. No wonder the public stopped appreciating the prevailing justice system and moving away from Dharmic system. It is the responsibility of contemporary commentators (or people who write laws of land) to interpret a dharmic-text in a scientific approach and ensure justice. <br /><br />I interpreted the above principle in Artha-shastra as “The king/government has the right to define social roles/responsibilities and appoint people to perform/implement them”. Anyone takes law in to their hands, without proper consent and appointment from the government, is punishable.    </div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">&quot;RamaY&quot;<br />Part 2 - Taxasila University (Excerpts from Sri Vedula Suryanarayana Sarma's Arya Chanakya)<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The city is carved out of stones (silas) and got its name Taxasila. The legend is that the university there has been established by Bharata, brother of Sri Rama. This university acted as the central university for all the other universities in subcontinent. Many students from all over the world come here to enhance their knowledge in all kinds of research fields.<br /><br />The professors in the university are personification of knowledge in the given fields. They are seers themselves and belong to all possible religious schools. The university has a separate wing for each subject matter, be it Vedas, Vedangas, Darshanas, Ayurveda, Mathematics, ArthaShastra, Constitutional sciences, Military sciences, geography  and astronomy, mantra sastra, gandharva (fine arts?) etc.,<br /><br />The key objective of any student is “seeking the truth”, not just knowledge acquisition or education as a mean to earn livelihood or fame. Jeevaka and Gautama (the Buddha) were alumni of this university. Charaka, a student of Atreya formulated his Astanga vidya in this university lab. Swetaketu, who is famed as the best guru in Varanasi, and Panini who wrote Sanskrit grammar are also alumni of this university. More than a hundred kings/princes have been educated in constitutional studies and weaponry etc in this university. <br /><br />Only students who completed their preliminary and medium-level education (up to 16 years old) and are qualified for higher education are accepted into the university. Each subject area is divided into 7 classes of 1year duration. By the time a student completes all 7 years of study, he becomes a complete authority in that body of knowledge. <br /><br />The gurus (teachers/professors) in the university are seers themselves and have only one purpose – safekeeping and propagation of Hindu Sanatana Dharma (Hindu eternal knowledge) . Some have given up worldly affiliations, and few others are parivrajakas (wandering monks). The university appointed selected monks and astrologers to wander around all corners of the world and identify children with extraordinary skills or horoscopes and somehow bring them to study in the university. <br /><br />The university library is a key aspect of this university. It has been established in a huge cave, with more than 1 sq. km area. Machines are setup to keep the air-circulation in the cave pristine in order to safe keep the numerous books and palm leave manuscripts. The books and manuscripts are arranged in large wooden and marble book cases 18-20 feet tall. The library is divided in to subject areas with each subject area maintained under a senior librarian. He guides the research students on which books to read based on their thesis areas. Within a subject area, there are separate librarians for each  sub-section who act as teaching assistants in the given area. </div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">&quot;RamaY&quot;<br /><br /><br />Part 3 - Political Strategies - Sama, Dana, Bheda, and Danda (excerpts from Sri Vedula Suryanarayana Sarma's Arya Chanakya)<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-weight: bold">Sukalpacharya</span> (a professor in Taxasila university) : What is your favorite strategy in Sama, Dana, Bheda, and Danda?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Chanakya</span>: Great question. I have thought a lot about this topic. I have analyzed in detail how each strategy works in different scenarios. At the end, I have decided that Bheda is the best strategy to win over enemy kingdoms/governments.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Sukalpacharya</span>: Isn’t Sama the best  and non-violent approach? Bheda requires one to be curled/crooked. That is why it is called “Kutila Tantra”. Why did you pick such a curled strategy leaving Sama which is Dharmic, and Dana approaches? Being a Brahmin how could you select such a violent strategy?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Chanakya</span>: It will be fruitless to use Sama, just because it is a non-violent approach. Every strategy has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the context. I believe that Sama and Dana to be effective while dealing with children, brethren and relatives, Dana and Bheda to  be effective in dealing with public, civil, and police superintendents, and finally Bheda and Danda to be effective in dealing with satraps and tribal leaders. <br /><br />To ensure that the public and citizenry do not collude with enemies the king should use all the three strategies except Danda. Danda is not possible in dealing with large populations. Even when it is possible to use Danda on citizenry it is ineffective and sometimes results in negative consequences. To ensure that citizenry doesn’t collude with enemies, one should buy of the satraps using Sama and Dana and influence the public thru them. <br /><br />In defeating an enemy, Sama’s utility is very minimum. Dana may work to some extent. But a mortal enemy will not get convinced with those approaches. How much money can we offer to an equal or more powerful enemy, to be effective? Perhaps we can use Dana to some extent as a prelude to Bheda strategy. <br /><br />Coming to Bheda strategy, it is the most effective in the hands of a leader/strategist, who alert and is capable of analyzing the characteristics of players and circumstances. It works as a magic to such strategists. This is the only strategy that can win over enemies with very little violence, loss of wealth and self-respect. But as you suggested, the whole process in Bheda strategy is curled. It is also true that at times one cannot show any sympathy and kindness in certain circumstances. However, As long as the overall vision and objective is to safeguard dharma and justice and to protect one’s national interests there is nothing wrong in applying this strategy. Of course if other strategies can achieve the overall national interests no need to take up this strategy, but expecting the enemies to be dharmic is not wise.<br /><br />There is one complexity in this strategy though. The enemy who is defeated using this strategy will not be able to forget his enmity. He will lay low till the right time and attack us when least expected. To ensure that doesn’t happen, one should keep a constant eye on such an enemy. One should establish marital relationship {in contemporary world, develop interdependent trade}, and slowly establish mutual cooperation until that enmity is erased. True statesmen appreciate opponents strategies and intelligence and become friends even when won thru Bheda strategy, but such statesmen are rare. <br /><br />In summary all strategies are good. It all depends on the context, circumstances and national interests. No strategy is better than the other.<br /> <br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Sukalpacharya</span>: I can see the logic in your approach, but cannot support bheda strategy { <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /> }. No wonder your professor “Kalyanacharya” calls you “Kautilya instead of Kautalya” to denote your interest in this crooked strategy. However, I wouldn’t say your thoughts are wrong. As long as your goal is to bring peace and prosperity to the world, any strategy should be good. Aren’t we all using bitter medication to cure our diseases? <br /><br />By the way for your strategy to be implemented you would need numerous spies,  who are good with multiple languages and guises, and are trained in various mantra sastras <span style="color: #0000BF">{applying chemicals to do magic, bio-weapons, etc}</span>. On top of it you would need a king who is dharmic and willing to implement your strategies to the dot.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Indu Sharma</span> (a classmate of Chanakya): There is no scarcity of spies guruji! There are numerous students who are glad to work as spies for Chanakya. They all were trained in the art of martial arts, weaponry, and mantra shastra <span style="color: #0000BF">{chemical, biological, and cosmological weaponry}</span>. Anyone of them can kill someone by throwing knife up to 100 dhanuvus (~200 ft?). This Chankya can throw a knife up to 300 ft. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Sukalpacharya</span>: I do not doubt Chanakya’s ability to gather suitable students. The entire Atharvana branch is under him <span style="color: #0000BF">{Atharvana veda is the home to all martial arts and sciences. If one wants to study Atharvana veda, he has to undergo second upanayana (thread ceremony) as the first upanayana is sufficient is good for Rig, Yajur and Sama Vedas only}</span>. Before him Taxasila university is limited to only three Vedas. After seeing Chanakya’s knowledge in Atharvana veda, our vice-chancellor    “Dharmananda” made him head of Atharva department. Thus Chanakya became a student and professor at the same time, and is called “Atharvana Brahmana”. <br /><br />More over our governing body is planning to make him the head of “Arthashastra” department as well. Then he can get additional students to further his cause. Great going!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Indu Sharma</span>: Not only that guruji. Since the beginning Chanakya use to help many students in their studies, thus gaining their respect and following. He already has more than hundred students who are willing to follow his path. And Chanakya trained them in spy-art and sent them around the subcontinent to gather intelligence, thus giving them necessary practical experience as well. All these hundred plus students are multi-lingual and exceptionally good in associated sciences. Siddharthaka, Nipunaka and Namiddharaka are top rank students in that.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Sukalpacharya</span>: Hmm, how are you guys managing to send all these students on those long trips? How are managing the financial resources?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Indu Sharma</span>: That is a secret. Chanakya, should I tell?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Chanakya</span>: There is no need for secrecy in front of gurus. Go ahead.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Indu Sharma</span>: Dear sir, I too did not know this secret until recently. Our Chanakya is an expert in making fake currency slabs. Using them he prints different types of coinage and stashes them in secret caves. He uses them to support student trips. He also helps many families financially using those fake coins. In addition to that his students earn significant amounts of foreign exchange while on international trips and submit it to Chanakya.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Sukalpacharya</span>: Great! So all ingredients are ready. All you need is a suitable dharmic king. I heard that Dharmananda (the vice-chancellor) brought a young sudra boy from pippalavana {Bihar-Nepal surroundings} and put him in constitutional studies class, along with other princes. Did you guys see that boy?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Indu Sharma</span>: Yes sir, I have seen that boy. He has all astrological symbols denoting a great the qualifications required for a great emperor. Wonder how Dharmananda found such a boy in the forest!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Sukalpacharya</span>: Dharmananda frequently goes on pilgrimages to bring such suitable boys/girls for higher education. He brought that boy from a tribal leader after paying him 300 golden coins. Everyone was saying that boy is sudra.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Chanakya</span>: What is in caste, as long as the person has intelligence, wisdom, knowledge, right attitude, and dharmic outlook? What is the use of a person born in higher caste if he doesn’t have any human characteristics? Even I was bought by Dharmananda to this university. He was roaming around Gautami region (Godavari) <span style="color: #0000BF">{Ramanaji – remember one day you wondered what is there in Godavari waters that make people think differently  <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> }</span>, and came to our house when he heard about my astrology. He stayed in our place for seven days and convinced my mother to send me this far. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Sukalpacharya</span>: I know that story about you. It is life ambition of Dharmananda to find people with special qualities and bring them to this great university. I hope one day all his efforts come to fruit, and the world bows to him in gratitude. <br /><br /></div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Excerpts from Arya Chanakya by Sri Vedula Surya Narayana Sarma - Part 0.<br /><br />Who is Chanakya?<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />Chanakya’s original name (name given by parents) is “<span style="font-weight: bold">Vishnu Gupta</span>”.<br /><br />Chanakya is mentioned as “dwyamushayayana = dwi + amushya + ayana = one who brought fame to two gotras (lineages). When the maternal grandfather doesn’t have any sons, the grandson is considered responsible for the after-life rituals of maternal forefathers. <br /><br />Chanakya had many functional names viz., Pakshilaswamy, Mallanaga, Chanakya, Vatsayana, Kautalya, and Kautilya.<br /><br />He is called <span style="font-weight: bold">Pakshialswamy</span> to indicate his interest and skill in training birds and animals to use them as spies and couriers.  <br /><br />He is called <span style="font-weight: bold">Mallanaga</span> to indicate his Andhra connection.

The bhedopaya is considered as a adharmic approach by contemporary philosophers as it involves twisting of truth, self-interests, and even violence; going against Hindu foundation of Dharma – virtuous path.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Part 4 - Greek Advancement (Excerpts from Arya Chanakya by Sri Vedula Surya Narayana Sarma)<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">There are many references which explain the Greek military advancement and the Indian states/kingdoms that fought against Alexander’s advancements. In this chapter, I would like to focus on the strategies used and the fault lines that were self-exposed</span><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>327 BC. <br /><br />Greek philosopher Aristotle’s student (some say his grandson) Alexander invaded Indian sub-continent, after his successful campaign on Persia, to fulfill his stated vision of establishing a single empire on the face earth under Greek control.<br /><br />Subahu, the old king of Taxasila lost his fighting will{ <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /> } after hearing that Alexander defeated Persians, under whom Taxasila kingdom was once a satrap. Many patriotic bharatiyas of Taxasila university tried to convince the old king otherwise, by offering the armed support of tens of thousands of university students <span style="color: #0000BF">{of martial arts and the using their goodwill to convince other Bharatiya kingdoms, I assume}</span> , but to no avail. Subahu, along with his sun Ambhi, instead met with Alexander in person and offered his respects by paying him great amounts of gold and agreed to be a feudatory of Greek empire. <br /><br />Alexander very well understood the close association between Hindu religion <span style="color: #0000BF">{for the lack of better word I am using “Religion” here – I prefer to use the word Sanatana Dharma, because that is what it is}</span>, the Dharma sastra <span style="color: #0000BF">{the social and cultural values}</span>, and the concept of state (national) wealth { <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /> }. He also understood that he cannot establish a lasting control on subcontinent unless these are separated and controlled individually. In order to gain insight into each one of these (and influence/control them) he wished to win the trust and partnership of senior professors of Taxasila University. He used all possible means to impart his intentions and vision on the “selected” seers of Taxasila. After some tactful effort (involving due-respect, worship, offering special Greek wines), he could gain the trust of <span style="font-weight: bold">Kalyanaswami </span>(the dean of department of Arthasastra) and the digambara seer <span style="font-weight: bold">Dandi</span>. Alexander successfully convinced these two seers to move to Greece to work with other Greek philosophers to develop united religion/methodologies required to establish a world-wide empire <span style="color: #0000BF">{The sad state of Indian intellectuals. 1. Unable to see the relationship between statecraft and underlying spiritual-religious-social structures. 2. Assuming that all other social/political structures to be equally pluralistic and dharmic}</span>.<br /><br />Subahu and Ambhi helped Alexander in convincing many regional satraps to become Greek-feudatories by offering financial and additional land-control incentives. <br /><br />In the course of his Indian Campaign, Alexander first met resistance from Hasti (Astes), the king of the small state of the Astakenoi, with the capital at Peucelaotis (Pushkalavati), modern Charsadda in the Peshawar district. He defied Alexander and stood siege of his walled capital for full 30 days. Hasti held out against the besiegers till the greater strength of the enemy beat him down. He fell fighting at the last moment. A trusted follower of the traitor king of Txasila called Sanjaya was rewarded for his loyalty to Alexander with the gift of this kindom { <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /> }.<br /><br />Andaka, the fort ruler of Kusadwhaja { <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /> } was captured by Greeks. After that Yavanas defeated Kasyapapura {Kashmir  <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /> }.  <br /><br />Akshobhya, king of Vaisapura accepted Alexander’s rule and became his feudatory. <br /><br />Aswajit, the king of Masakavati fought bravely and offered strong resistance. Alexander was able to overcome the opposition and the defenders had to incur heavy losses. After a long fight Alexander’s army killed Aswajit and captured his wide Kalapini Devi and son. Vijayavarma, the chief-commander of Masakavati  kingdom escaped along with his army to another fort Urnasa and started fighting with Alexander. Alexander tried a lot to defeat Vijayavarma but it proved to be a very difficult task. As a last resort, Alexander order Kalapini and son-of-Aswajit to brought to him and demanded Kalapini Devi to convince Vijayavarma to surrender and threatened to kill her son otherwise. Kalapini Devi{ <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /> } got attracted by Alexander’s charms and offered herself to him and asked Vijayavarma to surrender to Greek army and prepare for an alliance. Vijayavarma accepted the queen’s order at first but once understood the details, escaped from Yavana forces and died in a subsequent guerrilla fight. <br /><br />After that Yavana army invaded Dhatrupura and Udabandha Pura.<br /><br />Then Alexander, along with army, camped at Taxasila and sent a message to Panchala {Punjab <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /> } king Purushottama. Purushottam did not accept Alexander’s dominance and rejected to pay the feudal fee demanded. Subahu, the old king of Taxasila, was delighted this opportunity to revenge Purushottam and encouraged Alexander to invade Panchala. <br /><br />Alexander moved his army to the western bank of Vitasta river <span style="color: #0000BF">{Vitasta River is a major tributary of Jhelum River. It originates from Nila Kund, also called Vitastatru (Vetha-Vatur)}</span>. Purushottam also moved his enormous army along with his elephant-force to eastern bank of Vitasta. Alexander’s army was scared at the enormity of Purushottama’s army and took a long time to prepare a suitable strategy. After much delay, Alexander tricked Purushottama and attacked them unexpectedly by crossing the river unnoticed. In the resultant fight Purushottama’s son Arjuna lost his life. <br /><br />Purushottama is 6.5 foot tall and is extremely brave king. He, along with his 4000 cavalry, 300 elephant force, 30000 infantry fought valiantly and stopped Yavana advancement. Alexander, on the advice of Subahu, the old king of Taxasila, stopped direct fight with Purushottama and waited for the right opportunity. <br /><br />It was the full moon day in Sravana month, the Rakhi-Bhandan festival. On this day, Hindus celebrate the divine relationship of brothers and sisters; the men treat any woman who tied the Rakshabhandam to their wrist, and promise to protect their honor and dignity even at the loss of their own lives. In that evening Purushottama’s royal court was busy with Rakshabhandan celebrations. A woman wearing a veil approached Purushottama and tied a beautiful Rakshabhandana to his wrist. Then she informed{ <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /> } Purushottama that she is a woman who loved Alexander and left the celebrations.<br /><br />The next day Alexander entered into a great fight with Purushottama. In that fight Alexander came into the direct sight of Purushottama. With his spear aimed at Alexander, Purushottama got distracted{ <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /> } by the Rakshabhandan tied to his wrist and withdrew his aim. Noticing this hesitation in Purushottama, Ambhi (prince of Taxasila) encouraged Alexander to harm the elephant Purushottama was riding. The elephant got hurt and threw Purushottama to the ground, who later got imprisoned by Yavanas.<br /><br />Alexander was very much impressed by Purushottama’s valor and righteousness and offered his kingdom back along with equal status. Purushottama felt honored by this offer and accepted Yavana friendship.<br /><br />After the campaign on Panchala, Alexander won Simprapura and attacked Sangala Fort of Katheya kingdom. At this stage the Yavana army lost its professionalism and started rampaging { <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /> }the villages and janapadas (towns). They started killing cows (especially the ones that are carrying) for food, and started kidnapping and raping local women. <br /><br />Listening to the destruction the Yavana army caused  in Sangala Durga (capital of Katheya kingdom), the kings of Saubhuti and Bhagela submitted to Alexander’s greek army and became their feudatories.<br /><br />Alexander advanced to the banks of Vyasa river (Beas River). His army has to cross Vyasa river and travel in a desert land for <span style="font-weight: bold">12 days </span>to reach Ganga/Yamuna rivers. Beyond that is the Magadha kingdom. Alexander is highly spirited to win Magadha kingdom after listening about the immense wealth accumulated by Magadha. But his army got used to the joys associated in pillaging Indian villages and did not want to move ahead. Alexander resigned to this fact for the time being and camped at Vrishapala in anticipation to invade Magadha after regaining his army support.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Part 5 - Student Rebellion (Excerpts from Arya Chanakya by Sri Vedula Surya Narayana Sarma)<br /><br />I request the readers to observe the similarities between current geopolitical scenario and the events happened in Chanakya's time.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The unwillingness of Taxasila king to stand for Indian interests, and the increasing domination of advancing Greek forces in Indian political scene troubled the followers of Bharatiya Dharma in Taxasila University. It saddened them to stay passive when the very foundations of Indian interests are eroding. Soon this distress transformed into a student revolution. <br /><br />One fine evening the entire teaching and student bodies of Taxasila university are gathered to discuss action plan to thwart Greek advancement, and strengthen Indian socio-political institutions. More than six hundred teachers and professors and more than six thousand student body gathered in university auditorium.  Each attendee made a solemn promise to protect Indian dharmic way of life and Indian interests before entering the meeting hall. <br /><br />A great dais of six feet high has been setup facing east. Special seating arrangements were made for senior professors in the first row facing the dais. Remaining professors and thousands of students have been seated in twenty rows facing the dais in three directions. The whole house is waiting for the chief guest to start the meeting with mixed feelings of excitement and anxiety. <br /><br />Soon the chief guest and senior professor, Swami Dharmananda walked on to the stage with the student union leader showing the way.  The entire house stood in respect. Swami Dharmananda initiated a mass prayer with the entire house following his lead. The house seated in their locations in silence waiting for Dharmananda to deliver the much awaited speech and action plan.<br /><br />Swami Dharmananda looked intently at the entire house in front of him and spoke thus<br /><br />“<span style="font-style: italic">Honorable Dharmic gurus and dear students,<br /><br />The bad times has brought upon Bharat (Indian Sub-continent) due to lack of dharma, vision and valor in key kingdoms of Indian subcontinent. The dharmic-tree under which we all have flourished for thousands of years is being destroyed from its roots. Our kings have lost their nerves viewing Greek military advantages, and submitted their honor and the national interests to Greek hegemony. Encouraged by their early  victories, the Greeks have become fearless. Their love for cow-meat is hurting our religious belief that sees cows as embodiment of service and sacrifice. It has become a game for them to kidnap and rape Hindu women. Few hindus are intentionally giving their daughters to Greek military commanders so they can gain few favors in return. This has brought Greek involvement and influence into Hindu social practices and destroying our varna dharma (social order). The Greek  commanders are encouraging their soldiers to marry Hindu women, so they can influence future Indian generations to be loyal to Greek hegemony. All these developments are destroying Hindu dharma and civilization. This is a great sin. We have to do something so this trend of Indo-Greek inter-marriages as it has long term implications on Indian interests. This will spoil Hindu blood for all future generations and Hindu civilization will lose its spiritual and cultural identity. Bharat will be fine even when majority of lands are won by Greeks. Our future generations can recapture all our lands, when the situation is favorable. However, this intermixing of races would destroy any such hope for ever. This trend is a mortal threat to Hindu civilization and culture. <br /><br />Greek emperor, Alexander, has correctly understood that the foundation of Bharatiya culture is our Vedas, Upanishads, and Puranas. He also learned that Brahmanas are carrying the responsibility of protecting and propagating this Bharatiya knowledge from one generation to another. His strategy to establish permanent Greek hegemony on Bharatiya lands is to destroy this source of Indic knowledge forever. He has ordered his commanders to behead and hang any Brahman who is in the field of learning and teaching Vedas. His army is even offering 1000 gold coins for anyone who kills a veda brahman’s head and 500 gold coins to anyone who kills a sastra-brahman (who performs Hindu rituals for others). Few Indians themselves are showing the locations of brahmana houses to Greek army, to gain few hundred gold coins. The Greeks are not stopping with that. They are collecting and buying any veda or sastra script for 100 gold coins. For few selfish Indians it has become a profitable business. They are stealing hindu scripts from various places and selling it to Greeks. Many veda professors were enticed by Greek intellectuals to go to Greece and settle there.  These people were used to translate our eternal knowledge into their language and use our own strategies and knowledge on our lands and society. <br /><br />While all our Vedas are of immense value to our society, we should be fine as long as we can protect Atharvana veda from them. We will be at a complete loss if Greeks can get their hands on our Atharvana veda. Our esteemed gurus know how much effort has been put to resurrect Atharvana veda in this university. We brought a seed from Andhra country and enhanced that subject area. Thanks to the efforts of our beloved Vishnugupta this subject area is enhanced into an advanced branch of study in our university. Learned from his maternal grandfather our young professor Vishnugupta lead this branch and extended this field of study immensely. Everyone in this university is grateful to Vishnugupta in this regard. Our Atharvana veda is the home for all knowledge pertaining to weaponalogy, military industrial development, military strategies, and weapons of mass destruction. If we lose this knowledge, there is no hope of victory to Bharatiya kingsdoms. This veda is like our lifeline. We all should protect this knowledge with our lives.<br /><br />It is very unfortunate that some of our intellectuals are enticed by Greek strategies and left our camp and are supporting Greeks by giving them insight into our social and political fault-lines. The great digambaracharya Dandi fell into Greek trap of establishing a single human empire on the face of earth. The head of Arthasastra department, Kalyanaswamy got enticed with the opportunity to be the architect of Greek empire. These two intellectuals were like two eyes to our university. The Greek emperor, Alexander, somehow convinced these two great souls to turn against Indian interests. I still fail to believe that these two great scholars agreed to work with Alexander against Indian interests. Somehow I still believe that these two great souls joined Alexander, so that one day they can influence him on the greatness and finality of Hindu dharma. If it doesn’t happen so, it must be our greatest misfortune.<br /><br />Our entire culture is in the hands of our women folk. We must protect our women folk so they can protect our Dharma and culture. If we lose our focus in this aspect and get enticed by greed and desire, then it would amount to destroying our dharma with our own hands. We cannot accept Greek atrocities on our women society, who perform our dharma in practice and teach our next generations. If our women are intermixed/blended with Greek men then there is no hope for our civilization. <br /><br />What is the purpose of our valor if we cannot protect the honor of their women folk?<br /><br />Is there any worse timidity than allowing Greeks to kill the cow, something that we worship throughout our day, and something that represents the essence of Hindu dharma?<br /><br />How can we protect our future generations if we cannot protect the Brahmins who carry our knowledge from one generation to another?<br /><br />The time has come for all of us to do our Dharmic duty to protect our national interests. This gathering has been called to understand this imminent threat that thrust upon us, and decide our action plan.<br /><br />I have presented all facts in front of you. This is a life and death issue for our nation. I am able to identify the problem scope, but am not able to identify the action plan on my own. I request all wise and intellectual people to come forward and present their opinions, on how to halt the Greek advancement in order to safeguard our Dharma/value-system, without fear.</span>”<br /><br />This sober speech made every attendee contemplate on the graveness of the situation and their dharmic-duty to protect Bharatiya national interests. The entire gathering is resolute in their ambition but no one is sure of the strategy to be followed in achieving their goals. One after another, the gazes of the students as well as professors fell on young Chanakya to lead the student rebellion to its purpose.  <br /><br />Chanakya waited for few minutes to see if anyone else would be interested to lead the discussion. Realizing that no one else is ready to take the lead, Chankya stood up from his place and walked to the dais and stood next to Dharmanand. <br /><br />Sukalpacharya, who stood behind Dharmananda all this time, was delightful to see Chankya taking the lead and is certain of Indian victory! <br /><br /></div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Part 5 contd... - Student Rebellion (Excerpts from Arya Chanakya by Sri Vedula Surya Narayana Sarma)<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Chanakya did a sasthangapranama to Dharmananda and made the following speech:<br /><br />“<span style="font-style: italic">Respectable gurs and dear brothers!<br /><br />Dharmananada’s sober speech is very inspiring and forced us to introspect. We can definitely achieve victory in protecting our dharma, if we can maintain this spirit till end. We should not fear Greek strength. What is the point of worrying when we are surrounded by danger? The only option is to fight the danger without any hesitation until the danger is erased.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The key reason for Greeks to conquer our nation so easily is that our nation is split into multiple kingdoms and the lack of unity among those kings.</span> Each king thinks that they are independent and do not accept the sovereignty of Bharatiya monarch. If all these Bharatiya kings were to unite under a single monarch, no nation on earth or any other planet can subdue Bharat.<br /><br />Anyways, whatever happened has happened. The need of the hour is that we deliberate on the strategy to unite India and kick the Greeks out.<br /><br />The Yavana tree has started spreading its roots across India. Any further delay would make it impossible for us to remove the Greek influence on our society. <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">One approach is to make a deal with Greeks thru a strong Hindu king such that Greeks rule India as long as they do not interfere with our dharma, culture, and social structures</span>. </span>Another option is to unite all nationalistic Hindu kings and defeat Greeks in war and kick them out of our borders. First approach is a little easy and involves less violence, but is not a permanent solution. It is acceptable for a Hindu king to make an alliance with another Hindu king, but not a Yavana/Greek king. Yavanas are our permanent enemies <span style="text-decoration: underline">as their religion/dharma cannot co-exist with ours</span> {<span style="color: #0000FF">not vice versa</span>}.<br /><br />Yavanas entering into marital relationships with Hindu ruling families is a very dangerous phenomenon. In fact this strategy is not known to Greeks before. They have learned of this strategy from our NeetiShastra and applying it on our own society. <br /><br />This entire region (west of Sindhu river) has already been under Greek rule. <span style="text-decoration: underline">It is a very unfortunate that Panchala (Punjab) king Purushottama also fell for Alexander’s deception. It is a case study for all of us that shows the consequences of blind adherence to a given dharma without understanding the context. We cannot blame Purshottama alone for this as it is a result of over emphasis on dharma by our ancestors.</span> <br /><br />That brings us to immediate action plan that is required. <br /><br />There are still a few kingdoms in India that are not invaded by Greeks. Few patriotic kings are still loyal to Bharatiya dharma even after their defeat to Greeks. Few other armies are still rebelling against Yavanas. <br /><br />Now the statesmen amongst us should form into groups and go to those kingdoms with patriotic population under Greek occupation. We should use our skills to attract the common populace and strengthen their religious and national feelings. These people should increase the public’s interest on Hindu culture by giving speeches on Puranas and conducting mass religious rituals. We should write patriotic songs in local dialects and spread them across the nation by employing beggars. We should encourage public rebellion against those feudal  who are loyal to Greeks. We should create havoc in the kingdoms so that the new constitution is not settled in peoples minds and lives. <br /><br />We should identify strategies to create rivalry between various ministers and kingdoms. We should join one camp first to destroy the opposing camp and then destroy the first camp by weakening it from within. <span style="text-decoration: underline">We should support the low-classes and make them rebel against the upper classes. We should organize cross-class banquets and then create rumors that the upper-class people insulted the lower-class people. This will create a constant pressure on Yavana armies to maintain public order. We should then manage armed rebellions against those kingdoms and kick out the Yavana armies.</span> Since we cannot win Yavana armies in war at this point, it is a must to use these Bheda strategies to achieve our goals.<br /><br />My students visiting various Greek-occupied kingdoms confirmed that majority of Greek forces are missing their families and are looking forward to return to their country. We should create necessary propaganda so that Greeks are constantly reminded of their families and increase their desire to go back. It would further help our cause.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">We cannot win Alexander thru Sama strategy as he is overwhelmed with his desire to conquer the entire world. It is an illusion to expect that our Kalyana Swami or Dandi Swami can convince Alexander about peace and make him leave India. </span><br /><br />There is no strategy to convert an evil person into a good one as the evilness is the nature of his being. It is meaningless to keep our hopes on Dandi or Kalyana swami to convince Alexander on peace. All Indians from all regions, languages and Indic-religions must come together to fight this Greek invasion as no one will be a winner by the invading Greek influence. <br /><br />Currently the Yavana king, Alexander, has crossed the Sindhu river and encamped in Punjab. He is trying to inspire his armies in the name of rest at the cost of Purushottama’s kingdom. He wants to capture Magadha with the help of Purushottama’s army. We have to use this opportunity to gain the support of Magadha for our cause. I have already dispatched few of my students to Magadha to find out the necessary details and contacts. I would like to go there as soon as I hear from my students and execute my plan from there. <span style="font-weight: bold">I am confident of gaining the support of wealthy and powerful Andhras in Magadha.</span> Once we kick out the Greeks from Indian subcontinent, we can strengthen Magadha to become the monarch of all Indian kingdoms; similar to strengthening the body after curing it of the illness. My idea is to rebuild Magadha as the monarch of Indian sub-continent to preempt future foreign invasions. <br /><br />I am planning to visit Kasi as my first stop, so that I can deliberate with the intellectuals that visit that religious center from all over India and bring them onboard our plan. More over Kasi being the feudatory of Magadha will allow me to gain further insight into Magadha politics. <br /><br />These are my thoughts. Kindly speak up if you have better ideas. We can take the best idea and execute to it. But we must not delay any further. We need to start this agitation immediately. The young should lead this rebellion from front lines. The old and wise will support it forming its backbone.</span>”<br /><br />Chanakya’s speech brought new motivation into the entire gathering. Everyone agreed that Chanakya’s strategy is the best approach to fight the foreign invasion and the strong rival. The gathering elected Chanakya as the leader of the rebellion. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The followers of Bouddha and Jaina religions did not like and approve of the violent and deceptive methods of Chanakya’s strategy. They have decided to stay out of the rebellion, even though the Greek invasion is equally detrimental to their religious and social systems. </span><br /><br />A secret meeting has been held under a huge Banyan tree to further detail Chanakya’s strategy. Immediate, short-term, and long-term plans have been prepared. Key participants are divided into groups under a group leader who will act as the coordinator for that group and with external group leaders. Chanakya assigned the groups to various regions and outlined the short, medium, and long-term objectives for each group. Code-words and language has been provided for each group so that they can secretly communicate within the group and identify fellow students from other groups. Courier and communication channels are identified so that Chanakya can coordinate all the groups and send them revised plans as necessary.<br /><br />The entire program has been divided into two parts. In the first part, each group is directed to settle in allocated regions/kingdoms and establish necessary influence in public and governing circles. The second part is to dedicated to influence the rulers and population in such a way that they will fight amongst themselves and create chaos and unrest in those kingdoms. Key members are trained in using birds as couriers to communicate with Chanakya.<br /><br />People were confused with the absence of Chanakya’s best friend Indu Sharma and Bagarayana etc in these critical meetings. Chanakya assured them by informing that they were already dispatched to reach Magadha and encamp there.<br /><br />* Kumarajeeva, Gunavarma, Sanghabhooti were identified to lead the group that is assigned to <span style="font-weight: bold">Masakavati</span> kingdom.<br /><br />* Bhadragupta, ManiBhadra, and Swandhyamati are to lead the group assigned to <span style="font-weight: bold">Nangalapura</span>. <br /><br />* Dharma Kshema, Narayana Siromani, Agama Siddhi, Sivanadha Vachaspati took their team to <span style="font-weight: bold">Saubhuti Nagara</span>.<br /><br />* Prajnakaramati, Garbhapada are to lead the group that is assigned to <span style="font-weight: bold">Bhagela </span>kingdom<br /><br />* Nagesha Chintamani, Kumara Dandi, Harihara Siddhanti, Vasudatta, Purna Varma took their group to <span style="font-weight: bold">Vrishapala</span> where Greek forces are currently resting.<br /><br />* Saubhuti, Vinidra, KrutyaPaksha, Uddhanda Bharati went to <span style="font-weight: bold">Alaara</span> kingdom with their team.<br /><br />* Gunamatha, Swarna Deepti, Manju Sri, Jita Srama went to <span style="font-weight: bold">Karmanya</span><br /><br />* Buddhi Dhwaja, Rana Deva, Sautra Padi took their team to <span style="font-weight: bold">Brahmasthal</span><br /><br />* Guna Dhama, Gana Tantra, Rana Bhoji, Setu Madhava took their teams to <span style="font-weight: bold">Pushkalavati</span> <span style="font-style: italic">{modern day Peshawar}.</span><br /><br />* Gunadhya, Dhruvasiddhi took their teams to <span style="font-weight: bold">Malava</span> kingdom<br /><br />* Bhava Viveka, Paksha Dharacharya, Saketa Ramasarma took their respective teams to <span style="font-weight: bold">Kshudraka</span> kingdom<br /><br />* Abhyakara Gupta, Vardhamana, Seela Rakshata, Sudhakara lead their team to <span style="font-weight: bold">Varaha</span> kingdoms <br /><br />Each team took as many Vedic texts as they can carry so they can be saved from the Greek armies. <br /><br />Chanakya provided enough money to each group from his secret treasury. He also taught various methods from his Artha Shastra so each group can earn additional income as needed.<br /><br />Thus started the student rebellion to save Bharat from invading foreign super power.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Part 6 - Victory at Kashi (Excerpts from Arya Chanakya by Sri Vedula Surya Narayana Sarma)<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Varanasi is the abode of Veda education for time immemorial. Kasi kings provide the needed boarding and lodging services for the numerous visiting student community. Not only that.  Kasi kings were famous for the financial support they extend for all eligible students to attend Taxasila university for higher education. One of the Kasi kings, Brahmadatta sent his son to Taxasila for higher studies. In Veda and Vedanga Varanasi can compete with even Taxasila, but Taxasila is the  best university in the world in all other branches of education.<br /><br />The current king of Varanasi is Hrishikesa Varma. He is a feudatory of Magadha kingdom. He conducts a scholarly competition every year in four areas; Veda, Vedanga, Nyaya and Vyakarana (Grammar). The competition is conducted over five days with fifth day reserved for celebrations. <br /><br />Chanakya wanted to participate in those scholarly debates in that year.  He, along with his old mother and students tried to reach Varanasi before the competition but his older mother could not handle the stress associate. After much effort he arrived at Varanasi by night of fourth day. <br /><br />By that time the winners were selected. In Veda a long-term resident of Varanasi from Andhra, Syama Sastri won. Vedanga branch was won by a local pandit Jagannatha Bhattacharya. A Navadweepa pandita (?) named Govarthana Panditaraja won the Nyaya branch debates. Bhamahasidha from Kashmir won the Vyakarana competition.<br /><br />On the fifth day Chanakya got up early and took a dip in Ganga river and worshipped Viswanatha. After that he explained Sidhharthaka on how to behave in the royal assembly and sent him to sit in the commoner’s section. Then he took his mother blessings and went to the assembly. Upon reaching the royal assembly he directly went to kings throne and did a vedic-blessing. Upon seeing the heavenly radiance in Chanakya’s face the king came down from his throne and received Chanakya with due respect. Then Chanakya explained his interest to participate in the debate and the genuine reasons for the delay. After discussing this with his ministers, the king left the decision to the royal assembly filled with thousands of scholars.<br /><br />The entire royal assembly is filled with opinions. One section felt that since the winners were already selected Chanakya cannot be accepted into the process in the last minute. Another section opined that it would be interesting to see Chanakya’s talent.<br /><br />Then Siddharthaka stood from the audience section and argued that Chanakya should be given a chance to debate the winners because the whole purpose of the debate is to identify the best scholar in the gathering. It is unwise to follow rules when the rules are hampering the very purpose of those rules. More over our winners defeated so many scholars in the past four days. This young Brahmin will be nothing in front of them. This young man must be shown his true place so he will not disturb another great royal assembly with his arrogance.  The whole assembly agreed with this logic and advised the king allow Chanakya to have a chance in the debate.<br /><br />Syama Sastri started the debate with Chanakya in Vedas. The debate went for hours moving from one branch of Vedas to another. The entire assembly is mesmerized by the way the debate explored the secrets of Vedas. As they moved from one Veda to another Chanakya observed Syamastri’s weakness in Samaveda and defeated him in explaining the “Radhantara sama”. Syama Sastri accepted his defeated and hugged Chanakya in happiness.  <br /><br />Then Kautalya moved on to debating the sciences. In order to save time, he invited all the other three contenders to debate at the same time. First he would take the question from Nyaya scholar and before answering his question he would answer the previous question by Grammer scholar and pose a question to Vedanta scholar and return back to the Nyaya discussion and answer the question. This process went on for hours and eventually all the three competitors accepted their defeat. {This is a scholarly/Literary performance called Avadhanam in Telugu <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avadhanam">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avadhanam</a><!-- m -->}<br /><br />After the celebrations Syama Sastri, as a fellow telugu, invited Chanakya and his mother to his home. <br /><br />With his victory in the scholarly debate Chanakya gained the respect of thousands of scholars across  breadth and width of Indian sub-continent.  Everyday hundreds of them would visit Chanakya to clarify their doubts in various subjects.  In the process of clarifying those questions, Chanakya would explain them the political developments in north-west India, the destruction imposed on sanatana dharma by the Yavana invasions, and the need to fight the greek-influence to protect Hindu culture and civilization. He would inspire hundreds of students everyday by presenting them the resolution accepted by the Taxasila student organization. Chanakya accepted some of the students into his inner circle after carefully analyzing their interests and capabilities.<br /><br />Chanakya also interacted with various professors from Kashmir, Badarika, Haridwar, Nalanda, Tamralipti, Sudhanyakatakam (vijayada?), Vegi, Mathura, Navadweepa, Magadha, Mithila etc universities and convinced them to support Chanakya’s plan to unite Indian-subcontinent and protect Sanatana Dharma. <br /><br />Impressed by Gautami’s service and character Chanakya’s mother Devaki , one fine day, put forward the marriage proposal in front of Syama Sastri. All along Syama Sastri wanted to give his lone daughter Gautami to Chanakya in marriage, but stayed quite to respect the tradition where the grooms side approaches  the bride’s side with marriage proposal. Initially Chanakya refused to enter into grihastaasrama until his objective is achieved but was convinced by his mother’s request that he has to carry forward his lineage from both his maternal and paternal side. On an auspicious day Chanakya married Gautami in Varanasi.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>After marriage, Chanakya stayed in Varanasi for some more time.<br /><br />During this time Chanakya spent most of his time in visiting gurukulas and universities giving speeches on Dharma, the imminent Yanana threat and how to fight it. Hundreds and thousands of students joined his agitation and took a oath to follow his directions as and when required. He would also meet many visiting students and professors from across the Indian sub-continent and impress upon them the need of fighting the Greek influence. <br /><br />In the evenings till late night Chanakya would meet his students spies coming from various parts of the sub-continent and give further directions based on their progress thus far.<br /><br />Chanakya’s patriotism attracted people from all walks in to the Hindu revolution against Greek invasion. Slowly even Buddhist and Jaina scholars also started understanding the need for all Bharatiya spiritual paths to come together in protecting the Bharatiya Dharma. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Victory in Masakavati</span><br /><br />Queen Kalapini Devi (her story was mentioned in earlier posts) coronated her two year old son as the king and established ruthless rule with the help of Greek army. A Greek commander named Prithukesa used to act as her chief adviser and administrator in the kingdom.<br /><br />The greek soldiers under Prithukesa had no opposition in imposing their mark on the Masakavati society. Killing of cows, kidnapping and raping or women went unabated.<br /><br />This is the scene of society and greek rule in Masakavati when Chanakya’s students – Kumarajeeva, Gunavarma and Sanghabhuti arrived there with their fellow students. These three were elected as the leaders of their respective groups. Then the entire student group elected Kumarajeeva as the first leader who would coordinate between the three groups and be in contact with gurudeva Chanakya.<br /><br />Each student took a disguise suitable with their respective skills. They merged into the society and settled in various villages of Masakavati as businessmen, dancers, ironsmiths, goldsmiths, carpenters, and servers. <br /><br />Kumarajeeva, Sanghabhuti and Gunabhuti entered the capital of Masakavati as a monk, doctor, and astrologer respectively and gained public trust over a period of time. </div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Part  7 - Recapturing Masakavati (Excerpts from Arya Chanakya by Sri Vedula Surya Narayana Sarma)<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Kumara Jeeva setup a hermitage in one of the forests near Masakavati and settled there with a new name “Yogananda”. The remaining students of his group settled in nearby villages in different handicrafts and developed close association with the surrounding populace by their quality skills and produce. They would visit Yogananda frequently and talk about his greatness and good-advises (that he gave) with villagers. <br /><br />Slowly Yogananda developed close association with many villages and won their trust and reverence by offering them necessary psychological and spiritual support. He would encourage them to help each other and be united in solving their problems, often caused by the occupation forces. Yogananda used to discourse on the necessity of a interdependent society and how they can fight Yavana-abuses by developing a unified force against Rashtra.<br /><br />On the occasion of Ramanavami he made the following speech<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">Dear Ramabhaktas, <br />You all know the story Ramayana. You all know how bhagavan Rama destroyed the lanka kingdom and killed Ravana when he kidnapped Sita Devi. Hindu dharma did not show any mercy on people that humiliate Hindu women. Even the weak fight till death to protect the honor of his women in Hindu Dharma. Rama was not discouraged when he is faced with entire army of Ravana. He collected monkeys, bears and other forest animals as his army. He lead these unintelligent army with discipline. He first found where Ravana is hiding Sita. Then he found a way to cross the ocean. Finally he destroyed Ravana along with his hundred sons, millions of army, and kingdom. When dharma is on your side gods too will help you in fighting the evil.<br /><br />Let us see another epic, Mahabharata. The whole mahabharat war was to revenge the insult on Draupadi by Kauravas. Pandavas had to watch Dussasana insult Draupadi in royal congregation in order to keep their dharma. But that didn’t stop them from taking revenge at an appropriate time. They held that burning revenge in their hearts for thirteen years. When the time is right, they killed Duryodhana along with his ninety nine brothers and eleven Akshouhinis army. They accomplished all this with a smaller army of seven akshouhinis only. You also know what kind of death Keechaka received at the hands of Bhima. There is no greater duty for Hindus than protecting the honor of their women folk.<br /><br />Bhagavad Gita tells us that dharma gets destroyed when miscegenation happens in women folk. The very purpose of religion is to protect race and dharma rules. Ramayana and Mahabharata became our religious texts as they tell us how harmful it is to desire others’ women. What is the value in reading those books without understanding this essence of those great books? Isn’t it blasphemy for not following those epics when one is faced with similar situations? <br /></span><br /><br />Yogananda’s speech reminded the audience all the insults they have undergone in the hands of occupying Yavana forces, and instilled a deep sense of dharma-parirakshana in them. They left that congregation with mutual assurance to come to each other’s rescue as and when the right time comes.<br /><br />In a different corner of Masakavati kingdom, Sanghabhooti set up his camp as a doctor under the name of Ganesa Senaka Viraja. He started treating the poor for free and got a good name for his knowledge, practice and auspicious hand in no time. He would not only treat the people that come to him, but also advise them on personal and social hygiene as a good friend. Soon he became the preferred doctor for many wealthy and official citizenry of Masakavati. Soon Ganesa Senaka’s capabilities as a doctor came to Yavana commander Prudhukesa’s notice.<br /><br />Prudhukesa has been suffering from severe indigestion and piles complaint for a long time. The treatment given by Greek doctors not only failed to cure his illness but also became ineffective to suppress the symptoms over a period of time. Eventually this pain became so severe that Prudhukesha cannot fulfill his official duties without frequent rests. Hearing Ganesa Senaka’s talent Prudhukesha invites him to his palace for treatment.<br /><br />Upon arrival GaneshaSenaka checks Prudhukesha’s pulse and asks him if he wants immediate relief or long-term cure for his problem without asking any further details from the patient. Prudhukesha requests for immediate relief followed by a treatment for permanent cure. GaneshaSenaka pulls three small tablets from his pocket and asks Prudhukesha to take one immediately and one after every 20 minutes. Within an hour Prudhukesha falls asleep. GaneshaSenaka stays there talking with other Greek soldiers and commanders until Prudhukesha wakes up after 3 hours. Prudhukesha notices that all his pain is relieved and couldn’t contain his gratitude. He orders for a plate full of golden coins and requests GaneshaSenaka to take that gift. GaneshaSenaka politely declines that gold saying that “Hindu dharma prohibits the doctor to take any gift/fee from the patient until the ailment is completely cured”. Prudhukesha is impressed by this Hindu dharma as requests GaneshaSenaka to continue with his therapy to cure him permanently. GaneshaSenaka suggests that it would take him a year’s worth of treatment to cure Prudhukesha’s ailment and accepts to be Prudhukesha’s personal doctor upon his request.<br /><br />In no time Prudhukesha is impressed by Ganeshasenaka’s talent and dharmic nature and made him his confidante. Ganeshasenaka  too would offer timely advice to Prudhukesha not only on health matters but also on the interdependencies of body, nature and spirit. During his visits Ganesha Senaka would bring medicinal juices combined with alcoholic drinks for Prudhukesha and his soldiers in such a way that those drinks not only are tasteful but also rejuvenating. In free times GaneshaSenaka would tell hindu stories on how individual and social ailments can be cured not only by medicine but also thru puja/homa/mantra procedures. <br /><br />In another corner of that kingdom, Gunavarma established himself as an astrologer with a professional name “Uduraja Daivajna”. He demonstrated his unmatched knowledge and skill in astrology and mantra sastra and soon achieved fame in the entire kingdom as a talented astrologer. He not only advised people on individual issues but also offered astrological solutions at village and town level so the benefits are enjoyed by the entire population. He would occasionally inform the general public that astrological state of the foreign occupation is weakening and soon the auspicious time is coming to establish Hindu kingdom in the state, thus creating much-needed encouragement in general populace.<br /><br />Thus all three camps are successfully established as per Chanakya’s plan and sent him a message using the dove-courier requesting further action plan. Within a month the dove returned with a message from Gurudeva. Yogananda verified the message by checking Chanakya’s frontal teeth impression made on one corner of the message read the message to Ganeshasenaka and Uduraja Daivajna. The friends were happy and impressed by the plan given by Chanakya and dispersed knowing that their hard work is coming to fruitition soon.<br /><br />One of those days the late king Viswajit’s brother and current queen Kalaapini’s brother-in-law Prasenajit approached VudurajaDaivajna to check his horoscope. The astrologer informed him that soon he is going to become a king and the gods are going to help him soon in his accession to the throne.  Since then Prasenajit started waiting for Greek-withdrawal and started behaving like peoples’ leader helping and protecting their interests.<br /><br />One day the coronated prince and Kalapini’s kid son fell ill and the severity increased by the hour. The royal doctors couldn’t get any clue and soon Prudhukesha requested GanesaSenaka to take a look at the boy. Ganesha Senaka checked the boy and told the royals that the illness is severe and he can only keep the boy alive for seven days and beyond that the boy can be saved only by mantra-shastra. Soon VudurajaDaivajna was invited to help with the situation. He checked the boy’s horoscope and informed that only a special puja for “Mrityunjaya” can save the boy. He suggested that Yogananda is very pious and can help the kingdom in this time of need. The queen personally requested Yogananda to come to the capital and conduct the yoga-puja to save the kingdom from this difficult situation.<br /><br />Yogananda started Siva-Saptaha (Seven days of Shiva Yajna) and as part of the initiation process brought a young and healthy bull in the capital as Shiva’s carrier, decorated it with shiva’s symbols of Shula and Dhamara and released it to roam in the capital. People would offer this bull flowers and fresh grass as it roams in the capital streets. People from entire kingdom were invited to participate in this yajna as it is meant to save the king and thus kingdom.<br /><br />Everyday Yogananda would offer Shiva’s yajna prasada as medication to the young king in addition to GaneshaSena’s medications. <br /><br />Students settled in various janapadas in the kingdom advised the citizens visiting the capital to carry concealed weapons to save their women folk from any untoward advancements by Greek soldiers. The citizenry, already inspired by Yogananda’s speeches, carried small and concealed knifes and swords along with them as they arrived into the capital with their families.<br /><br />Finally the final and seventh day of the yajna arrived. The young king has shown some improvement in his health, and it has been attributed to the Siva Yajna by Yogananda and the royal as well as the public interest and reverence in the yajna reached its peaks. Everyone spoke about the effectiveness of Hindu yajnas and super-natural nature of Hindu traditions. The greek soldiers realized that all the stories that Ganeshasena told them are not untrue. Upon their request Prudhukesha announced a public holiday for all Greek soldiers on that day.<br /><br />Ganeshasenaka prepared a special arrack for Greek Soldiers by mixing locally made arrack and some herbal juices to add flavor, taste and effectiveness. The Greek soldiers drank that arrack without limits and were roaming around the city intoxicated. <br /><br />That night after completing the daily rituals, Yogananda made a religious discourse breaking his seven-day mauna-vrita. Entire capital sat silent to hear Yogananda’s speech – <br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">Deal Shivabhaktas,<br /><br />With today this Siva Yajna is coming to an end. Now with the blessings of Siva we will see the results of this yajna. First, let us learn the concept of Siva. Siva is our God consciousness. In creating his form/murti we can understand how our Hindu-seers brought that god-consciousness to our senses. <br /><br />We all know that food is key to life. Life comes from the essence of food. Life achieves consciousness from food. From that comes the mind’s activity. From that activity one can achieve knowledge. Using that knowledge one can see/understand god-consciousness. For all this to happen, food is the key. That is why it has been said that “food is god”.<br /><br />That food comes from cultivation. Farmers cultivate lands by tilling the land using bulls and adding water. Farming is the profession that gives us food. That hardwork doesn’t have draughts. A farmer is working day and night living in between all kinds of poisonous creatures. And then he is sacrificing his hard work to the rest of society in the form of harvest. How can we not view such a farmer as nothing but personification of god? This same concept has been put in Siva’s murti by our seers.<br /><br />Embodiment of the farming process is Siva. To demonstrate the importance of water to his field, he held “Ganga” on his head. He held “Trishul” as the tool for tilling. He made bull as his chariot. He made hills and planes as his home instead of towns and cities. He would wear bare minimum while fulfilling everyone else’s desires. He has no wealth even though he is the creator of wealth for the rest of the society. Can anyone show any other god than him? His form is god for us. His profession is the path to be followed. His carrier, bull, is an object to be worshipped and revered.<br /></span><br /><br />Thus going Yogananda’s speech. Suddenly a big commotion heard at the northern gate of the capital fort. People ran in that direction. Soon shouts were heard saying “the Greek soldiers killed the holy bull and are burning it to eat. Kill these Greeks who killed the holy bull!”. The entire crowd arose in fury and started killing Greek soldiers upon seeing them. The Greek soldiers could not move at all under the influence of arrack they have been drinking since morning. Soon the entire Greek army is killed without leaving a single soldier.<br /><br />The crowd surrounded Prudhukesha’s palace to kill him. Hearing what happened to his soldiers, Prudhukesha escaped under disguise. <br /><br />The night passed and the entire capital is filled with dead bodies of Greek soldiers. The public setup a meeting to discuss further action. They contended that the queen and young king must be killed to protect the long-term interests of the kingdom. Both were brought out and beheaded in front of entire public for betraying the nation. <br /><br />Then the public democratically elected Prasenajit as their new king and Yogananda as their prime minister and royal-advisor. <br /><br />Thus implementing Chanakya’s strategy for Masakavati, Kumarajeeva sent Sanghabhuti to meet guru-deva to inform about the victory at Masakavati and get further directions.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">History of Nanda Rajas. </span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Rakshasa's original name is Subuddhi Sarma</span>. He is called Rakshasa as he shows no mercy in fulfilling his ministerial duties, but no cruel. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">King of Magadha, Sisunaga Mahananda</span></span> had two wives Mura Devi and Sunanda Devi. Mura Devi is daughter of Pippalavana King. He is a Kshatriya king but briefly left Hinduism for Buddhism. Even though he returned to Hinduism within no time; he became <span style="font-style: italic">vratya</span> and called Shudra by Brahmins.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0040BF">{Here <span style="font-style: italic">Chanakya</span> criticizes the Brahmana's for their short-sightedness. He correctly observes that in their dislike for other faiths Brahmins lost many opportunities to save their own Dharma. If one returns to Hinduism then s/he must be a true philosopher as s/he understood Hinduism for what it is instead of blindly following it by birth. Due to such people Hinduism's philosophical and spiritual is re-affirmed.}<br /></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sisunaga Mahananda has a son called Kumara Gupta by Muradevi.</span></span> He also had two more sons from Sunanda Devi. <br /><br />Magadha people denied Kumara Gupta the kingdom as he is a sudra. In the court Bhadrasala (chief army commander) and Rakshasa supported this view and played against Kumara Gupta. Ministers Nakranasa and Sakatala supported Maurya's candidacy to the throne as he not only is a Kshatriya but also an able administrator. Other ministers we indifferent at the beginning but eventually sided with Rakshasa. The king Sisunaga Mahananda had to agree to this even though he wanted Maurya to succeed him. He made Kumara Gupta as commander to his personal security.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0040BF">{This shows that the Indic kingdoms followed a finer version of democracy even though the power transfer is hereditary in most cases.}</span> <br /><br />Later the public was very impressed by Kumara Gupta's character and honesty and liked him more than the king but the damage was done.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0040BF">{This is where Chanakya decides Maurya-lineage as his candidate to be the future Indian Monarch. <span style="font-style: italic">Please note the parallel's between the selection of Pandava's by Sri Krishna in Sri Hebbar Nageswara Rao's article (posted in Indian Interests)</span>}</span><br /><br />***<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Mahananda had someone called Ugrasena as his personal barber.</span> Ugrasena's father is a Kshatriya and mother is a Shudra. Ugrasena took the barber profession for his livelihood. <span style="color: #0040BF">{Notice the acceptance of inter-caste marriage (within the varnasrama framework) and the entire services industry is in sudra realm.} </span>. Mahananda accepted him as the royal barber due to his Kshatriya parenthood. Ugrasena is a strong person and has received Kshatriya training. He used to lead a gang of thieves in the nights for additional income. <br /><br />In no time he became a trusted subordinate of Mahananda and got a job in Magadha army. There he became a key commander by demonstrating his war-fighting and leadership capabilities. He was instrumental in defeating the Kalinga army and merging it in Magadha. He lead Magadha army in many battles and won many other kingdoms. <br /><br />Sunanda Devi got attracted to Ugrasena after hearing his greatness and his physical charms. Their affair was a secret for more than a year. On a fateful night Ugrasena killed Mahananda and his two sons (by Sunanda Devi) with the help of Sunanda Devi. <br /><br />After this he declared himself as the king of Magadha under a new name &quot;<span style="font-weight: bold">Mahapadma Nanda</span>&quot;. The entire kingdom was so scared of him that they had to accept his kingship. <br /><br />Minister Sakatala's son is the only person who did not accept this power transition and fought openly with Mahapadma Nanda. This teenager was captured and killed and buried in one corner of the fort. Minister Sakatala was forcibly blinded and kept under house-arrest. <br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Then Mahapadma Nanda (Ugrasena) publicly married Sunanda Devi and coronated as king of Magadha. They had eight sons, the eldest son's name being Sukalpa Nanda. Including Mahapadma Nanda these are Nava Nandas.</span><br /><br />***<br /><br />Later Mahapadma Nanda arrested all those thieves and decoits, whom at one time he lead, and relieved the kingdom of the fear of thieves. He defeated Himalaya, Kuntala, Yamuna, and Brahmaputra regional kingdoms and brought entire Arya-vratta under his rule. He established exceptional governance system in his kingdom. After settling the kingdom; he donated large agraharas (farm lands and villages) to many acharyas such as <span style="font-weight: bold">Vararuchi, Vyadhi, and Varsha</span> etc., <br /><br />Mahapadma Nanda respected and took care of people of all religions, races and varnas. He gave the armed-forces the highest position in his kingdom (<span style="font-style: italic">Note for our leadership</span>). He ensured that the taxes are collected without any exceptions and spent significant amounts on building tanks and canals. He established new scales and weights for businesses. <span style="font-weight: bold">He encouraged and promoted only capable and trustworthy people</span> and removed all show-man from government positions.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Mahapadma Nanda respected Kumaragupta Maurya's capabilities and character and positioned him as a key commander in his army.</span> Kumaragupta Maurya too became a trusted commander of Mahapadma Nanda and respected him as his king. Maurya had many wives and had many sons and daughters from them. <span style="font-weight: bold">All his hundred plus children were called Mauryas</span>. Kumaragupta Maurya's hundred plus sons got their father's capabilities and military skills. <span style="font-weight: bold">Mahapadma Nanda hired all the sons of Maurya and made them as his personal Royal Gaurd.</span> <br /><br />The citizenry of Magadha secretly hated Mahapadma Nanda's non-kshatriya birth and his deceptive ascension to the throne. At the same time they accepted and appreciated his able leadership and prosperity his rule brought to them. Things went well as long as Mahapadma Nanda was at helm. As he grew old Mahapadma Nanda became highly temperamental and behaved like a dictator. <br /><br />One fine day he made his eldest son Sukalpa Nanda as the king under the ministership of Rakshasa. He took a solemn oath from Rakshasa that he would be eternally loyal to his children and lineage and protect them with all his capabilities. Then he receded to vanaprastha as &quot;<span style="font-weight: bold">Sarvartha Siddhi</span>&quot;  <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> . <br /><br />***<br /><br />As soon as he became the king Sukalpa Nanda removed Nakranasa as the prime-minister and replaced him with Rakshasa. In order to win the public support Rakshasa made significant donations to Brahmins. Everyday thousand brahmins are invited to royal banquet. A golden chair studded with rare gems is reserved for a vedic brahmin after which the kings seat is placed (to show that vedic brahmin is more respectable than the king in Magadha). <span style="color: #0040BF">{This strategy is to keep the intellectual class happy and loyal to the royal court}</span><br /><br />These eight Nandas got their father's arrogance but not his fighting/leadership qualities. Soon the royal court is filled with cronyism and corruption. For some time they listened to Raksha's ideas but soon his advises were over ruled in favor of selected coterie.   <br /><br />Most of the royal ministers were set aside. Rakshasa, bound by his oath, kept all these ministers in good spirit in order to protect Nanda interests. <br /><br />***<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">will post Maurya story tomorrow.</span></div>

			<div class="content">Distance between young Nandas and Mauryas increased after Mahapadma Nanda's retirement. Despite Rakshasa's repeated requests Nandas started expressing their jealousy against Mauryas publicly. The removed Kumaragupta Maurya from chief commandar's position and put Bhadrasala in his position.<br /><br />Nanda's didn't satisfy with that. They wanted to eliminate Mauryas completely out of jealousy. They took help from an architect called Daruvarma and constructed a beautiful building with a huge underground basement. They announced that the new building will be used as a command center and for secret royal discussions and often conducted key governance meetings in that bunker. <br /><br />After sometime they encouraged the royal priest to initiate pilgrimage to Prayaga for SarvarthaSiddhi (Mahapadma Nanda). Rakshasa too joined that pilgrimage suspecting some deceptive action by Nandas.<br /><br />A week later Nandas invited Kumaragupta Maurya along with his 100+ sons to a royal feast in the bunker and locked them in that bunker. Only halfday's worth of food for these 100+ Mauryas was available in that building. Kumaragupta sensed Nanda's plan and wanted to keep at least one of them alive to avenge their death. After much discussion mauryas elected young Chandragupta to be the one, given him being the youngest of Mauryas and Rakshasa's special affection towards him. <br /><br />Kumaragupta beheaded all other Mauryas and committed suicide. Chandragupta continued to live on the remaining food with a burning desire to avenge his family's destruction by Nandas.<br /><br />After a couple of months Nandas received news that Mahapadma Nanda is on his way back from the pilgrimage. They didn't know how to convey the destruction of Mauryas to Mahapadma Nanda. They opened the bunker and found 100 skeletons in one corner and barely alive Chandragupta next to them. They took pity on Chandragupta and put him under medical supervision. Then they sent a note to Mahapadma Nanda that all Mauryas except Chandragupta were killed in a fire accident in the newly built command center.<br /><br />Mahapadma Nanda realized his childrens' hand in Maurya destruction and lost his interest in their kingdom. He took a promise from Rakshasa to protect his sons and went to forests to live a Vanaprastha life. <br /><br />After his recovering, Nanda's sent Chandragupta to his grand-parents house in Pippalavana where he lived for a while.<br /><br />Later Takshasila's chancellor Dharmanada found Chandragupta's qualities, astrology to be of a future monarch and brought him to Takshasila university and put him in political science department. <br /><br />After Takshasila university student body meeting, chandragupta returned to Magadha to fight any future Yavana influence using his past connections. He returned to Magadha and joined the royal administration under a shudra name/lineage. <br /><br />Nakranasa and Indusharma (Chanakya's Magadha batch) are the key supporters of Maurya at this point.</div>

			<div class="content">Delhi, The book store name I don't remember but it was in DLF Select Citywalk Saket. I had asked the store keeper to keep it aside for me as I had to watch a movie. But forgot to pick it up afterwards, I also have Chanakya on management By Ashok R. Garde published by Jaico Publishing House. It is about using the principles of Arthashastra in order to manage modern organisation. I have unfortunately not read this book Inspite of having it for almost 4 years. But my father used it as refrence material when he was conducting a seminar in his office. <br /><br />He was very impressed by it. Will start to read it over the next weak and let you know just what it is all about as I go along.<br /><br />Added later Arthashastra <a href="http://bharateeya.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/arthashastra-of-chanakya-english/" class="postlink">Ebook</a> in English &amp; Sanskrit, Am not able to dowanload this from my office. Will try from Home.</div>
